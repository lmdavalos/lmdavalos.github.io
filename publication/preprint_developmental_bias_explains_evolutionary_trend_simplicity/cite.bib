	abstract = {The relative influence of developmental bias and natural selection on evolutionary outcomes remains a central, unresolved question in evolutionary biology. Here, we combine large-scale phylogenetic trees with herbarium data to confirm that, across the evolutionary history of angiosperms, transitions from complex to simple leaf shapes have occurred at a significantly higher rate than the reverse. To investigate whether this directional trend reflects an underlying developmental bias, we simulate evolutionary transitions by introducing random mutations into a well-established computational model of leaf development. Despite excluding selection, the transition rates produced by the model closely align with those observed in the phylogenetic data. This agreement indicates that a strong developmental bias, reflecting the relative ease with which gene regulatory networks generate simple over complex leaves, has played a major role in shaping the evolution of leaf morphology. Our findings echo recent work showing that similar biases towards simplicity influence the evolution of molecular structures, including RNA secondary structures and protein quaternary assemblies. Together, these results suggest that a developmental bias favouring simplicity may be a widespread and general feature of evolutionary systems.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.JSM was supported by funding from the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (UKRI-BBSRC) [grant number BB/T008784/1].
