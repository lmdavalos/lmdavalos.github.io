However, many subfamilies share a similar insect-feeding morphotype, apparently stable over millions of generations. Is the diversity of phyllostomid traits adaptive, and does it contribute to species diversity in the family? We evaluate predictions from Simpson’s ecological theory of adaptive radiation, applied to comparative trait analyses since 2000. The shift to higher rates of taxonomic diversification at the base of Stenodermatinae, new skull architecture capable of great bite force despite small size, and a distinctive olfactory receptor profile make this subfamily a radiation by itself. The stenodermatine skull architecture also enables making leaf tents, a new roost adaptive zone that contributes to the diversity of this subfamily. The evolution of distinct trophic adaptive zones characterized by optima in cranial musculature and mechanical advantage shows that stenodermatines are not the only phyllostomid lineage responding to ecological opportunities. Instead, nectarivores have unique cranial traits and occupy their own trophic adaptive zone, while a subset of insectivores together with sanguivores share a similarly high trophic level. There is also evidence of convergent and adaptive evolution in cranial traits associated with similar trophic levels, as well as adaptations coupled with dietary specialization in digestive and renal function. While linked to higher rates of taxonomic diversification only among stenodermatines, these various adaptations demonstrate the response of phenotypic form to diverse ecological function that makes phyllostomid bats unique.","tags":["adaptive radiation","trophic level","Stenodermatinae","Phyllostomidae","Ornstein-Uhlenbeck","adaptation","diversification"],"title":"Adapt or Live: Adaptation, Convergent Evolution, and Plesiomorphy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Theodore H.

Family-wide genetic sequence data starting in the early 2000s, however, showed that this phylogeny obscured the taxonomy, biogeography, and evolution of ecological traits in the family. Current phylogenies strongly support the monophyly of 11 subfamilies, as well as most relationships among them. Nonetheless, the positions of several key groups are not well-supported and require further analyses, including: 1) Micronycterinae relative to Desmodontinae, 2) Lonchorhininae, and 3) the genus-level resolution of Miocene fossils. Historical biogeographic analyses have revealed a South American origin for most subfamilies; have inferred widespread and multi-continental distributions for ancient ancestors; and have rejected a special influence of Quaternary glaciations on recent speciation. These analyses have also confirmed North and Central America, as well as South America, as independent centers of diversification for some subfamilies (e.g., Macrotinae), as well as within subfamilies (e.g., Glossophaginae). These parallel centers of diversity might result from the absence of continuous dry habitat corridors between the continents, but this hypothesis has not been tested using phyloclimatic methods. Biogeographic analyses of individual genera have demonstrated the importance of the Andes for diversification in Platyrrhinus, Sturnira, and Uroderma, as well as the critical role of humid forest corridors between Central and South America for the long-term dispersal of these lineages.","tags":["adaptive radiation","Miocene","Micronycterinae","Phyllostomidae","Desmodontinae","Lonchorhininae","diversification","historical biogeography"],"title":"Phylogenetics and Historical Biogeography","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Liliana M.

High-quality genomes are crucial for understanding the molecular basis and evolution of these traits. Here we incorporated long-read sequencing and state-of-the-art scaffolding protocols1 to generate, to our knowledge, the first reference-quality genomes of six bat species (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, Rousettus aegyptiacus, Phyllostomus discolor, Myotis myotis, Pipistrellus kuhlii and Molossus molossus). We integrated gene projections from our ‘Tool to infer Orthologs from Genome Alignments’ (TOGA) software with de novo and homology gene predictions as well as short- and long-read transcriptomics to generate highly complete gene annotations. To resolve the phylogenetic position of bats within Laurasiatheria, we applied several phylogenetic methods to comprehensive sets of orthologous protein-coding and noncoding regions of the genome, and identified a basal origin for bats within Scrotifera. Our genome-wide screens revealed positive selection on hearing-related genes in the ancestral branch of bats, which is indicative of laryngeal echolocation being an ancestral trait in this clade. We found selection and loss of immunity-related genes (including pro-inflammatory NF-κB regulators) and expansions of anti-viral APOBEC3 genes, which highlights molecular mechanisms that may contribute to the exceptional immunity of bats. Genomic integrations of diverse viruses provide a genomic record of historical tolerance to viral infection in bats. Finally, we found and experimentally validated bat-specific variation in microRNAs, which may regulate bat-specific gene-expression programs. Our reference-quality bat genomes provide the resources required to uncover and validate the genomic basis of adaptations of bats, and stimulate new avenues of research that are directly relevant to human health and disease1.","tags":["genomics","adaptation","Evolutionary genetics","gene family evolution","immune response"],"title":"Six reference-quality genomes reveal evolution of bat adaptations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kai Wang","Shilin Tian","Jorge Galindo-González","Liliana M.

New genome assemblies from two neotropical fruit bats (Artibeus jamaicensis and Sturnira hondurensis ) provide a framework for comparisons with Old World fruit bats. Comparative genomics of 10 bat species encompassing dietary diversity across the phylogeny revealed convergent molecular signatures of frugivory in both multigene family evolution and single‐copy genes. Evidence for convergent molecular adaptations associated with frugivorous diets includes the composition of three subfamilies of olfactory receptor genes, losses of three bitter taste receptor genes, losses of two digestive enzyme genes and convergent amino acid substitutions in several metabolic genes. By identifying suites of adaptations associated with the convergent evolution of frugivory, our analyses both reveal the extent of molecular mechanisms under selection in dietary shifts and will facilitate future studies of molecular ecology in mammals.","tags":["Evolutionary genetics","positive selection","niche specialization","frugivory","chemosensation","gene family evolution","olfactory receptors","taste receptors","olfaction"],"title":"Molecular adaptation and convergent evolution of frugivory in Old World and neotropical fruit bats","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Liliana M.

While new mutations are commonly considered engines of adaptive change, sensory evolution enabling access to new resources might also arise from standing genetic diversity, and even gene loss. We examine the relative contribution of molecular adaptations, measured by positive and relaxed selection, acting on eye-expressed genes associated with shifts to new adaptive zones in ecologically diverse bats from the superfamily Noctilionoidea. Collectively, noctilionoids display remarkable ecological breadth, from highly diver- gent echolocation to flight strategies linked to specialized insectivory, the parallel evolution of diverse plant-based diets (e.g., nectar, pollen and fruit) from ancestral insectivory, and—unusually for echolocating bats—often have large, well-developed eyes. We report contrasting levels of positive selection in genes associated with the development, maintenance and scope of visual function, tracing back to the origins of noctilionoids and Phyllostomidae (the bat family with most dietary diversity), instead of during shifts to novel diets. Generalized plant visiting was not associated with exceptional molecular adaptation, and exploration of these novel niches took place in an ancestral phyllostomid genetic background. In contrast, evidence for positive selection in vision genes was found at subsequent shifts to either nectarivory or frugivory. Thus, neotropical noctilionoids that use visual cues for identifying food and roosts, as well as for orientation, were effectively preadapted, with subsequent molecular adaptations in nectar-feeding lineages and the subfamily Stenodermatinae of fig-eating bats fine-tuning pre-existing visual adaptations for specialized purposes.","tags":["Evolutionary genetics","transcription","positive selection","preadaptation","diversification","niche specialization","frugivory","vision"],"title":"Foraging shifts and visual preadaptation in ecologically diverse bats","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1583956711,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583956711,"objectID":"c680cac0fe2733b327d9e7eabd974200","permalink":"/people/semel_jessica/","publishdate":"2020-03-11T15:58:31-04:00","relpermalink":"/people/semel_jessica/","section":"people","summary":"UG student.","tags":["Researchers"],"title":"Jessica Semel","type":"people"},{"authors":["Anusha Shankar","Donald R Powers","Liliana M.

According to the metabolic level boundaries hypothesis, metabolic rates as a function of mass are expected to scale closer to 0.67 when driven by surface‐related processes (e.g., heat or water flux), while volume‐related processes (e.g., activity) generate slopes closer to one. In birds, daily energy expenditure (DEE) scales with body mass (M) in the relationship log (DEE) = 2.35 + 0.68 * log (M), consistent with surface‐level processes driving the relationship. However, taxon‐specific patterns differ from the scaling slope of all birds. Hummingbirds have the highest mass‐specific metabolic rates among all vertebrates. Previous studies on a few hummingbird species, without accounting for the phylogeny, estimated that the DEE‐body mass relationship for hummingbirds was log (DEE) = 1.72 + 1.21 * log (M). Contrary to theoretical expectations, this slope greater than 1 indicates that larger hummingbirds are less metabolically efficient than smaller hummingbirds. We collected DEE and mass data for 12 hummingbird species, which, combined with published data, represented 17 hummingbird species in eight of nine hummingbird clades over a six‐fold size range of body size (2.7 ‐ 17.5 g). After accounting for phylogenetic relatedness, we found daily energy expenditure scales with body mass as log (DEE) = 2.04 + 0.95 * log (M). This slope of 0.95 is lower than previously estimated for hummingbirds, but much higher than the slope for all birds (0.68). The high slopes of torpor, hovering and flight potentially explain the high interspecific DEE slope for hummingbirds compared to other endotherms.","tags":["allometry","adaptation","phylogenetic regression","hummingbirds"],"title":"The allometry of daily energy expenditure in hummingbirds: an energy budget approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

While the relative abundance of a gene subfamily in the subgenome may reflect its functional importance, tests based on this expectation can be confounded by the complex relationship between the birth-death process of gene subfamily evolution and the species phylogeny. Using simulations, we confirmed tree heterogeneity as a confounding factor in inferring multi-gene adaptation, causing spurious associations between shifts in birth-death rate and lineages with higher branching rates. We then used the olfactory receptor (OR) repertoire, the largest gene family in the mammalian genome, of different bat species with divergent diets to test whether expansions in olfactory receptors are associated with shifts to frugivorous diets. After accounting for tree heterogeneity, we robustly inferred that certain OR subfamilies exhibited expansions associated with dietary shifts to frugivory.

With a Gini coefficient of 0.50 in 2017, Colombia has the greatest inequality of land ownership in the Americas after Brazil 2, distorting land-use practices for all landholders. While the frequency distribution of land tenure is unknown in the absence of an updated national property registry, 1% of holders held a total of 56 Mha (81%) of productive land in 2014, and most of these were large holdings 500 ha (Fig. 1) 3.","tags":["cattle","Amazon-Andes","deforestation","land grabbing","Amazon","inequality"],"title":"Curb land grabbing to save the Amazon","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Laurel R.

A series of protocols to optimize tissue collection from bats has been developed for a series of high-throughput sequencing approaches. Outlined here are protocols for the capture of bats, desired demographics to be collected for each bat, and optimized methods to minimize stress on a bat during tissue collection. Specifically outlined are methods for collecting and treating tissue to obtain (i) DNA for high molecular weight genomic analyses, (ii) RNA for tissue-specific transcriptomes, and (iii) proteins for proteomic-level analyses. Lastly, also outlined is a method to avoid lethal sampling by creating viable primary cell cultures from wing clips. A central motivation of these methods is to maximize the amount of potential molecular and morphological data for each bat and suggest optimal ways to preserve tissues so they retain their value as new methods develop in the future. This standardization has become particularly important as initiatives to sequence chromosome-level, error-free genomes of species across the world have emerged, in which multiple scientific parties are spearheading the sequencing of different taxonomic groups. The protocols outlined herein define the ideal tissue collection and tissue preservation methods for Bat1K, the consortium that is sequencing the genomes of every species of bat.","tags":["genomics","adaptation","Evolutionary genetics","transcriptomics","cell culture","proteomics"],"title":"Tissue Collection of Bats for-Omics Analyses and Primary Cell Culture","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Laurel R.

Molecular analyses of these gene families require high‐confidence sequences, but the high sequence similarity of the members can create challenges for sequencing and downstream analyses. Focusing on the common vampire bat, Desmodus rotundus, we evaluated how different sequencing approaches performed in recovering the largest mammalian protein‐coding multigene family: olfactory receptors (OR). Using the genome as a reference, we determined the proportion of putatively protein‐coding receptors recovered by: 1) amplicons from degenerate primers sequenced via Sanger technology, 2) RNA‐Seq of the main olfactory epithelium, and 3) those genes “captured” with probes designed from transcriptomes of closely‐related species. Our initial re‐annotation of the high‐quality vampire bat genome resulted in 400 intact OR genes, more than doubling the original estimate. Sanger‐sequenced amplicons performed the poorest among the three approaches, detecting 50% of the annotated genomic ORs, and targeted sequence capture recovered nearly 75% of annotated genes. Each sequencing approach assembled high‐quality sequences, even if it did not recover all receptors in the genome. While some variation may be due to limitations of the study design (e.g. different individuals), variation among approaches was mostly caused by low coverage of some receptors rather than high rates of assembly error. Given this variability, we caution against using the counts of intact receptors per species to model the birth‐death process of multigene families. Instead, our results support the use of orthologous sequences to explore and model the evolutionary processes shaping these genes.","tags":["genomics","bait capture","chemosensation","Evolutionary genetics","gene family evolution","olfactory receptors"],"title":"Evaluating the performance of targeted sequence capture, RNA-Seq, and degenerate-primer PCR cloning for sequencing the largest mammalian multigene family","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eleonora Dávalos","Liliana M.

Despite the obvious relevance of smallholding growers to the strategies to control illicit crops, there are few insights into what motivates these smallholders to cultivate coca. We analyse the motivations of coca growers by estimating a discrete choice model including head of household characteristics, household variables, and agricultural unit attributes. We found that extremely poor farmers are more likely to grow coca than non-poor farmers in the same area, while households connected to the energy grid, with access to credit, and receiving cash payments for their licit crops, are less likely to grow coca crops. Our results suggest that strategies aiming to discourage farmers from growing coca should: 1) target specifically the poorest households in the region and not just seek to improve general living conditions, 2) expand rural electrification, and 3) enhance legal productivity by providing access to credit, technical support, and/or contracts on harvests before planting.","tags":["Andes","Colombia","coca","electrification","credit"],"title":"Social Investment and Smallholder Coca Cultivation in Colombia","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Laurel R.

Between species, the number of intact receptors can vary by orders of magnitude. However, the evolutionary processes behind variation in receptor number, and its link to fitness-related behaviors are not well understood. From vomeronasal transcriptomes, we discovered the first evidence of intact vomeronasal type-1 receptor (V1r) genes in bats, and we tested whether putatively functional bat receptors were orthologous to those of related taxa, or whether bats have evolved novel receptors. Instead of lineage-specific duplications, we found that bat V1rs in bats show high levels of orthology to those of their relatives, and receptors are under comparative levels of purifying selection compared to non-bats. Despite widespread vomeronasal organ loss in bats, V1r copies have been retained for 65 million years. The highly conserved nature of bat V1rs challenges our current understanding of mammalian V1r function and suggest roles other than conspecific recognition or mating initiation in social behavior.","tags":["Laurasiatheria","transcriptomics","Birth-death models","chemosensation","pseudogene","gene family evolution","Evolutionary genetics","vomeronasal system","pheromone"],"title":"Expressed vomeronasal type-1 receptors (V1rs) in bats uncover conserved sequences underlying social chemical signaling","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1563739111,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1563739111,"objectID":"fdbc43be82e891de921325a356991e04","permalink":"/people/goldberg_aaron/","publishdate":"2019-07-21T15:58:31-04:00","relpermalink":"/people/goldberg_aaron/","section":"people","summary":"Graduated (MA) Spring 2011.","tags":["AlumniPG"],"title":"Aaron Goldberg","type":"people"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1563739111,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1563739111,"objectID":"87bf87020b6daaa4ccad8864eb1d68f6","permalink":"/people/bruno_alessondra/","publishdate":"2019-07-21T15:58:31-04:00","relpermalink":"/people/bruno_alessondra/","section":"people","summary":"Kings Park High School, 2014.","tags":["AlumniHS"],"title":"Alessondra Bruno","type":"people"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1563739111,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1563739111,"objectID":"4a11a4fb2f9580d4bdb1e97a67f1dc58","permalink":"/people/lengers_alex/","publishdate":"2019-07-21T15:58:31-04:00","relpermalink":"/people/lengers_alex/","section":"people","summary":"Graduated (MA) Spring 2017.","tags":["AlumniPG"],"title":"Alex Lengers","type":"people"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1563739111,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1563739111,"objectID":"10cd4eff44d078de73a503c139a8050f","permalink":"/people/brown_alexis/","publishdate":"2019-07-21T15:58:31-04:00","relpermalink":"/people/brown_alexis/","section":"people","summary":"PhD Student and RAPID RA.","tags":["Researchers"],"title":"Alexis Brown","type":"people"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1563739111,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1563739111,"objectID":"5ced1f76ce637990296a191664d35dda","permalink":"/people/mcpherran_anna/","publishdate":"2019-07-21T15:58:31-04:00","relpermalink":"/people/mcpherran_anna/","section":"people","summary":"PhD Student and STRIDE Fellow.","tags":["Researchers"],"title":"Anna McPherran","type":"people"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1563739111,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1563739111,"objectID":"2eb5e1a4de24157c4da8325e39490d78","permalink":"/people/szeto_anne/","publishdate":"2019-07-21T15:58:31-04:00","relpermalink":"/people/szeto_anne/","section":"people","summary":"Graduated (BSc) Spring 2011.","tags":["AlumniUG"],"title":"Anne Szeto","type":"people"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1563739111,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1563739111,"objectID":"94c9a5c744cb490269cefbac0018f4bf","permalink":"/people/patil_bhavana/","publishdate":"2019-07-21T15:58:31-04:00","relpermalink":"/people/patil_bhavana/","section":"people","summary":"Dimensions REU, 2015.","tags":["AlumniUG"],"title":"Bhavana Patil","type":"people"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1563739111,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1563739111,"objectID":"530e2094e2a3250facc99d9e407db902","permalink":"/people/lei_bonnie/","publishdate":"2019-07-21T15:58:31-04:00","relpermalink":"/people/lei_bonnie/","section":"people","summary":"Walnut High School, 2010.

Tightly integrated structures typically evolve in unison, whereas loosely integrated structures evolve separately. Highly integrated structures are therefore thought to constrain evolutionary change by limiting morphological disparity. Mounting evidence suggests that high integration may facilitate evolutionary change along a single trajectory. We used geometric morphometrics to compare cranial disparity and integration among phyllostomid bats—which exhibit the greatest dietary diversity of any mammalian family— and their sister taxa within the superfamily Noctilionoidea. Our results reveal that phyllostomids are more tightly integrated and have less disparity in cranial shape than their outgroups, despite exhibiting tenfold higher species richness and significantly increased rates of speciation. Phyllostomid cranial morphology appears to have diverged from that of other noctilionoids by evolving along a single axis of morphological variation that describes the relative length of the rostrum. We propose that phyllostomids were able to evolve to occupy a wide range of dietary niches by varying rostrum length, possibly along a line of least evolutionary resistance. This study provides a compelling empirical example of how increased integration can lead to adaptation, implying that both high and low integration can underlie diverse phenotypes in adaptive radiation.","tags":["Morphological evolution","3D morphometrics","Phyllostomidae","Noctilionoidea"],"title":"Morphological Diversification under High Integration in a Hyper Diverse Mammal Clade","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Academic is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.

Consequently, repeated evolution of the same genetic mechanisms may occur across high-elevation taxa. To test this prediction, we investigated the extent to which the same biochemical pathways, genes, or sites were subject to parallel molecular evolution for 12 Andean hummingbird species (family: Trochilidae) representing several independent transitions to high elevation across the phylogeny. Across high-elevation species, we discovered parallel evolution for several pathways and genes with evidence of positive selection. In particular, positively selected genes were frequently part of cellular respiration, metabolism, or cell death pathways. To further examine the role of elevation in our analyses, we compared results for low- and high-elevation species and tested different thresholds for defining elevation categories. In analyses with different elevation thresholds, positively selected genes reflected similar functions and pathways, even though there were almost no specific genes in common. For example, EPAS1 (HIF2α), which has been implicated in high-elevation adaptation in other vertebrates, shows a signature of positive selection when high-elevation is defined broadly (1,500 m), but not when defined narrowly (2,500 m). Although a few biochemical pathways and genes change predictably as part of hummingbird adaptation to high-elevation conditions, independent lineages have rarely adapted via the same substitutions.","tags":["Evolutionary genetics","Transcriptomics","adaptation","dN/dS","phylogenetics","convergence","hummingbirds"],"title":"Parallel molecular evolution in pathways, genes, and sites in high-elevation hummingbirds revealed by comparative transcriptomics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Liliana M.

These two research approaches offer much promise to address not only many of the fundamental questions about life, but also many of the problems facing humanity, including the irreversible, ongoing, and rapid loss of biodiversity.\nConservation biologists have so far focused on risks of extinction, decline and collapse of species and ecosystems, while recognizing how just avoiding loss is not enough. Until recently, the ultimate goals of biodiversity conservation—recovery and restoration—have remained difficult, elusive, and vaguely defined. Earlier this year, a new framework for assessing species recovery and conservation success has been proposed. A central concept of this framework is the ecological functionality of populations, based on the idea that conserving species requires not only avoiding extinction, but also maintaining their contributions to ecosystem processes.\nThe practical application of this framework requires fundamental research about the relationships between ecological function and other organismal and genetic dimensions of biodiversity. We propose to develop a cross-scale research program that focuses on the relationships between phylogenetic diversity, genetic diversity and functional diversity of a biologically and economically important taxonomic group: bees.\nThe overall goal of the proposed research is to test hypotheses on the relationships among multiple dimensions of biological diversity, and their relevance for functioning of ecological communities. Our specific objectives for this OVPR Seed Proposal focus on preparing a strong initial proposal for NSF, potentially followed by additional proposals. We aim to 1. Obtain preliminary genomic data via RNA transcripts and hybridization baits, 2. Start developing a database of ecological functionality to relate species to their molecular and ecological function, 3. Recruit collaborators to strengthen specific aspects of the planned proposal.\nWe have extensive experience in both the general subject area of the proposal, and the specific methodological and conceptual advances that underlie the proposed research program. However, we have never collaborated before, and we lack preliminary data on the system we propose to focus on. In order to build the collaboration and establish the preliminary data to successfully compete, we need the internal support provided by the OVPR seed funding. With funding from the OVPR Seed Grant Program, we plan to develop a new collaboration and a new research program that will likely lead to several externally funded projects over the coming 5-10 years. Our initial target will be the NSF program on Dimensions of Biodiversity ($2M total), but we expect that we will have multiple opportunities for external funding in the next year or so..\n","date":1548460800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548460800,"objectID":"607d4a17c409bc00f7da5ac6cb8faf64","permalink":"/project/very_extended_phenotype/","publishdate":"2019-01-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/very_extended_phenotype/","section":"project","summary":"We propose to develop a cross-scale research program that focuses on the relationships between phylogenetic diversity, genetic diversity and functional diversity of a biologically and economically important taxonomic group; bats.","tags":["genomics","tropical biology","expired"],"title":"The Very Extended Phenotype: connecting genetics and evolution to ecological function","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1548460800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548460800,"objectID":"5d69843ec4a0f9f0def91f9d5be5421e","permalink":"/project/death_and_life_of_biodiversity/","publishdate":"2019-01-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/death_and_life_of_biodiversity/","section":"project","summary":"Data available for new students.

Molecular studies of loss have tended to focus on gene sequences alone, but overlooking other aspects of protein expression might underestimate phenotypic diversity. Insights based almost solely on opsin gene evolution, for instance, have made mammalian color vision a textbook example of phenotypic loss. We address this gap by investigating retention and loss of opsin genes, transcripts, and proteins across ecologically diverse noctilionoid bats. We find multiple, independent losses of short-wave-sensitive opsins. Mismatches between putatively functional DNA sequences, mRNA transcripts, and proteins implicate transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes in the ongoing loss of S-opsins in some noctilionoid bats. Our results provide a snapshot of evolution in progress during phenotypic trait loss, and suggest vertebrate visual phenotypes cannot always be predicted from genotypes alone. *Co-corresponding authors","tags":["opsins","short-wave opsin","transcription","translation","phylogenetic regression","pseudogene","mixed models","hierarchical models","relaxed selection","Evolutionary genetics"],"title":"Multifactorial processes underlie parallel opsin loss in neotropical bats","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marisa Cheun-Wah Lim"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1542326400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1542326400,"objectID":"7259d35440b5fdfae80711bb44fa662a","permalink":"/publication/thesis_on_the_evolution_diversification/","publishdate":"2018-11-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/thesis_on_the_evolution_diversification/","section":"publication","summary":"At first look, the harsh physical conditions of the Andes should impose serious physiological constraints on hummingbirds, but instead, they have a wide distribution and are abundant at high altitudes. Several studies suggest highland species are well adapted to these harsh conditions. Genetic adaptation is difficult to study in non-model organisms, especially as laboratory experiments are impractical for long-lived species. However, new genomic methods have revealed specific amino acid changes, genes, and biochemical pathways that are repeatedly involved in adaptation to survival in high altitude environments. My dissertation research addresses two questions: 1) What is the genetic basis for high-altitude adaptation in Andean hummingbirds? And 2) Are the mechanisms the same across divergent taxa and populations? I generated transcriptome data for 12 Andean hummingbird species occurring from low to high elevations that independently colonized the Peruvian Andes. Parallel molecular evolution can occur at any of several hierarchical levels of biological organization. I identified parallel evolution across highland species for several pathways, including those related to cellular respiration and cell death, but the genes and mutations often differed. I next examined these questions for populations of lowland and highland species in the Peruvian Andes. I conducted an exon capture sequencing experiment to map their spatial population genomic variation and to test for associations between genetic patterns and elevation while accounting for demographic history. I found that isolation by distance and physical barriers play principal roles in shaping spatial population genomic variation. In addition to population divergence, I also identified clinal variation in allele frequencies across elevation for SNPs in several genes with previous links to highland adaptation. Collectively, my results for Andean hummingbird species and populations indicate there is predictability in the genetic mechanisms of adaptation to high altitude, though there are a variety of adaptive paths. By investigating how organisms evolved to thrive in challenging environmental conditions, we can illuminate the mechanisms of evolution and refine future study of the units on which evolution acts.","tags":["Andean hummingbirds","hummingbirds","Evolution","diversification"],"title":"On the Evolution and Diversification of Andean Hummingbirds","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Laurel R.

Understanding when gene duplicates contribute new molecular functions to genomes through molecular adaptation is one important goal in comparative genomics. In large gene families, however, characterizing adaptation and neofunctionalization across species is challenging, as models have traditionally quantified the timing of duplications without considering underlying gene trees. This protocol combines multiple approaches to detect adaptation in protein duplicates at a phylogenetic scale. We include a description of models for gene tree-species tree reconciliation that enable different types of inference, as well as a practical guide to their use. Although simulation-based approaches successfully detect shifts in the rate of duplication/retention, the conflation between the duplication and retention processes, the distinct trajectories of duplicates under non-, sub-, and neofunctionalization, as well as dosage effects offer hitherto unexplored analytical avenues. We introduce mathematical descriptions of these probabilities and offer a road map to computational implementation whose starting point is parsimony reconciliation. Sequence evolution information based on the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous nucleotide substitution rates (dN/dS) can be combined with duplicate survival probabilities to better predict the emergence of new molecular functions in retained duplicates. Together, these methods enable characterization of potentially adaptive candidate duplicates whose neofunctionalization may contribute to phenotypic divergence across species.","tags":["Gene duplication","Gene tree","Birth-death models","Molecular evolution","dN/dS"],"title":"Protocols for the Molecular Evolutionary Analysis of Membrane Protein Gene Duplicates","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Liliana M.

While the importance of acoustic traits for foraging and communication in echolocating mammals suggests adaptation, the seldom-tested null hypothesis to explain trait divergence is genetic drift. Here we derive FST values from multi-locus coalescent isolation-with-migration models, and couple them with estimates of quantitative trait divergence, or PST, to test drift as the evolutionary process responsible for phenotypic divergence in island populations of the Pteronotus parnellii species complex. Compared to traditional comparisons of PST to FST, the migration-based estimates of FST are unidirectional instead of bidirectional, simultaneously integrate variation among loci and individuals, and posterior densities of PST and FST can be compared directly. We found the evolution of higher call frequencies is inconsistent with genetic drift for the Hispaniolan population, despite many generations of isolation from its Puerto Rican counterpart. While the Hispaniolan population displays dimorphism in call frequencies, the higher frequency of the females is incompatible with sexual selection. Instead, cultural drift toward higher frequencies among Hispaniolan females might explain the divergence. By integrating Bayesian coalescent and trait analyses, this study demonstrates a powerful approach to testing genetic drift as the default evolutionary mechanism of trait differentiation between populations.","tags":["Evolutionary genetics","Population genetics","Bayesian","hierarchical models","mixed models","coalescence","Pteronotus","Pteronotus portoricensis","Pteronotus pusillus"],"title":"A coalescent-based estimator of genetic drift, and acoustic divergence in the Pteronotus parnellii species complex","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Danny Rojas","Matthew Moreira","Maria João Ramos Pereira","Carlos Fonseca","Liliana M.

This database includes shapefiles with taxonomic information and the extent of occurrence for each species, and has been used in hundreds of studies in ecology, biogeography and conservation. Here we provide updated distribution maps that comprise the extent of occurrence of the neotropical bat species in the superfamily Noctilionoidea (Mammalia: Chiroptera) after a thorough research of new records published between January 2008 and March 2018. The main motivation for this update was the inclusion of spatial and climatic variables in explaining the ecological and taxonomic diversity of noctilionoid bats. The core of the superfamily (246 species distributed in five families out of 250 species) occurs in the Neotropics and shows ecological diversity unparalleled among mammals. This clade also shows the only evolutionary shift towards higher speciation rates within the order Chiroptera. Updating the range maps for these bats resulted in the modification of maps of 94 species, and the creation of new maps for 37 species missing from the IUCN database. From the 94 modified maps, 55 species increased their latitudinal range and 38 increased their longitudinal range. These modifications did not change the overall extent of occurrence of the clade. Altogether, modified and new maps represent 53% of Noctilionoidea.

Evaluating the effects of coca cultivation has become a priority because averting deforestation has become a priority to reduce carbon emissions in the Amazon. Here I use models of tropical deforestation, one based on immiserization and the other on frontier development, to evaluate the role of coca cultivation in land use change. While both models are consistent with deforestation by campesino smallholders, only the frontier model predicts infrastructure investment increases forest loss. Contrary to the assumption of previous studies relating deforestation to coca, deforestation rates tend to be lower in areas with coca cultivation in Colombia and Peru, with the reverse tendency in Bolivia. Probabilistic models of deforestation controlling for a series of confounding variables confirmed no tendency of coca cultivation to increase or decrease deforestation rates in Colombia. Additionally, analyses examining the relationship between coca cultivation and migration to the Colombian frontier failed to find a consistent relationship, implying illicit crops are not the cause of migration. Instead, deforestation traces back to mid twentieth-century state-sponsored roads and colonization projects that promoted mass migration to the frontier. In time, as investment and other support dwindled, campesinos turned to coca as a competitive cash crop.","tags":["Bolivia","Peru","Colombia","illicit crops","development","Marginal de la Selva"],"title":"The Ghosts of Development Past: Deforestation and Coca in Western Amazonia","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Paul Gootenberg","Liliana M.

The mammalian vomeronasal system, a sense critical for mediating many social and reproductive behaviors, is highly conserved across mammals. New World Leaf-nosed bats (Phyllostomidae) are under strong selection to maintain a functional vomeronasal system such that most phyllostomids possess a distinct vomeronasal organ and an intact TRPC2, a gene encoding a protein primarily involved in vomeronasal sensory neuron signal transduction. Recent genetic evidence, however, shows that TRPC2 is a pseudogene in some Caribbean nectarivorous phyllostomids. The loss-of-function mutations suggest the sensory neural tissue of the vomeronasal organ is absent in these species despite strong selection on this gene in its mainland relatives, but the anatomy was unknown in most Caribbean nectarivorous phyllostomids until this study. We used diffusible iodine-based contrast-enhanced computed tomography (diceCT) to test whether the vomeronasal and main olfactory anatomy of several phyllostomid species matched genetic evidence of function, providing insight into whether loss of a structure is linked to pseudogenization of a molecular component of the system. The vomeronasal organ is indeed rudimentary or absent in species with a disrupted TRPC2 gene. Caribbean nectar-feeders also exhibit derived olfactory turbinal morphology and a large olfactory recess that differs from closely related bats that have an intact vomeronasal organ, which may hint that the main olfactory system may compensate for loss.

The mammalian vomeronasal system, which detects social chemical cues important to fitness, is an impressive example of a sensory system lost multiple times. Three times more losses are inferred among bats than in other mammalian orders. We characterized the relationship between amino acid substitutions in a gene tightly linked to vomeronasal function (Trpc2) and the accessory olfactory bulb, a brain region that processes the detection of these vomeronasal chemical cues. By applying a phylogenetic logistic regression, we found a strong negative relationship between the branch lengths representing rates of codon changes in the Trpc2 gene tree and the presence or absence of an accessory olfactory bulb. Longer branch lengths predict loss of the accessory olfactory bulb, suggesting selection has relaxed on the system as a whole. Based on this relationship, we predicted the absence of an accessory olfactory bulb in 19 bat species with unknown morphology. Several species with predicted losses have specialized skull morphology, suggesting a potential tradeoff between adaptation in skull shape and maintenance of the vomeronasal system. This study offers a new approach to relate genetic mechanisms and phenotypes at a macroevolutionary scale.","tags":["chemosensation","gene tree","macroevolution","phylogenetic logistic regression","Trpc2","vestigial","vomeronasal system","Phyllostomidae","phylogenetic regression","Codon models"],"title":"Strength of selection on the Trpc2 gene predicts accessory olfactory bulb form in bat vomeronasal evolution","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jennifer S.

Large-bodied mammals and several bats were extinct by the Archaic, following protracted extinction dynamics perhaps reflecting habitat loss.

To uncover the consequences of overlooking this spatial component, we tested both spatially explicit and non‐spatial models of deforestation for Colombia. Parameter estimates, analyses of residual spatial autocorrelation, and Bayesian posterior predictive checks were used to compare model performance. Significant residual correlation showed that non‐spatial models failed to adequately explain the spatial structure of the data. Posterior predictive checks revealed that spatially explicit models had strong predictive power for the entire range of the response variable and only failed to predict outliers, in contrast with non‐spatial models, which lacked predictive power for all response values. The predictive power of non‐spatial models was especially low in regions away from Colombia's center, where about half the observations were clustered.

Mammals have a secondary chemosensory system known as vomerolfaction that is primarily attributed to detecting pheromones, chemical cues that mediate many social behaviors. Vomeronasal mechanisms are conserved across mammals because of vomerolfaction’s critical roles in reproduction and social communication. Such mechanisms include the pheromone detection by vomeronasal receptors (e.g. V1Rs) and signal transduction of the Transient receptor potential cation channel 2 (Trpc2), an ion channel indispensable for vomeronasal function. Despite a nocturnal lifestyle and gregarious behaviors, most bats surprisingly lack a functioning vomeronasal system, exhibiting degraded vomeronasal morphology and pseudogenized Trpc2 and V1Rs. New World Leaf-nosed bats (Phyllostomidae) are one of the few exceptions where the vomeronasal system is well maintained. It is unclear whether phyllostomids have retained vomeronasal function through time while other bats have independently lost function or if they have regained the functional sensory system, potentially serving as a key innovation related to their diversity. To address this question, I sequenced the V1R profiles from the vomeronasal transcriptome from a diversity of phyllostomids and sequenced Trpc2 exon 2 in over 100 bats across nearly every family.  Compiling the V1R data with existing mammal species, the phylogenetic history of the gene tree suggested phyllostomids V1Rs are completely orthologous with the dog and horse, providing no evidence that phyllostomids have evolved a new set of vomeronasal receptors. Additionally, many non-phyllostomids showed independent pseudogenizing mutations of Trpc2 while phyllostomids showed a signature of strong purifying selection to maintain a functional Trpc2. I simulated sequences under similar selection constraints to determine if it Trpc2 was under relaxed selection early within the phylogeny or if purifying selection has been prevalent throughout the evolutionary history of phyllostomid bats. My results showed it was unlikely that Trpc2 reactivated and supports the notion that phyllostomids have maintained vomeronasal function since the divergence with other laurasiatherians. My results also emphasize that the chemosensory system is a crucial aspect of sensory biology for some bats, a modality often underappreciated in light of other extreme bat senses.","tags":["Bats","Chemosensation","Molecular evolution","Pheromone","Phylogenetics","Vomeronasal system"],"title":"The Molecular Evolution of Bat Chemosensory Pathways Reveals Sensory Innovation and Loss","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dolors Armenteras","Cerian Gibbes","Jesús A.

The United Nations program on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) aims to sustainably manage forests, as well as to conserve and enhance their carbon stocks. Despite the crucial role of fire management, decision‐making on REDD+ interventions fails to systematically include fires. Here, we address this critical knowledge gap in two ways. First, we review REDD+ projects and programs to assess the inclusion of fires in monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) systems. Second, we model the relationship between fire and forest for a pilot site in Colombia using near‐real‐time (NRT) fire monitoring data derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The literature review revealed fire remains to be incorporated as a key component of MRV systems. Spatially explicit modeling of land use change showed the probability of deforestation declined sharply with increasing distance to the nearest fire the preceding year (multi‐year model area under the curve [AUC] 0.82). Deforestation predictions based on the model performed better than the official REDD early‐warning system. The model AUC for 2013 and 2014 was 0.81, compared to 0.52 for the early‐warning system in 2013 and 0.68 in 2014. This demonstrates NRT fire monitoring is a powerful tool to predict sites of forest deforestation. Applying new, publicly available, and open‐access NRT fire data should be an essential element of early‐warning systems to detect and prevent deforestation. Our results provide tools for improving both the current MRV systems, and the deforestation early‐warning system in Colombia.","tags":["edge","fires","deforestation","MODIS","monitoring"],"title":"Integrating remotely sensed fires for predicting deforestation for REDD+","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Laurel R.

These families either regained vomerolfaction after ancestral loss, or there were many independent losses after diversification from an ancestor with functional vomerolfaction. In this study, we use the Transient receptor potential cation channel 2 (Trpc2) as a molecular marker for testing the evolutionary mechanisms of loss and gain of the mammalian vomeronasal system. We sequenced Trpc2 exon 2 in over 100 bat species across 17 of 20 chiropteran families. Most families showed independent pseudogenizing mutations in Trpc2, but the reading frame was highly conserved in phyllostomids and miniopterids.

Although theory predicts biodiversity on islands tends towards an equilibrium value, the recent extinction of large proportions of island biotas complicates testing this model.

Here, we reconstruct the diversity trajectory in noctilionoid bats of the Greater Antilles by applying a dynamic model of colonization, extinction and speciation to phylogenetic and palaeontological data including all known extinct and extant species. We show species richness asymptotes to an equilibrium value, a demonstration of natural equilibrium dynamics across an entire community. However, recent extinctions—many caused by humans—have wiped out nearly a third of island lineages, dragging diversity away from equilibrium. Using a metric to measure island biodiversity loss, we estimate it will take at least eight million years to regain pre-human diversity levels. Our integrative approach reveals how anthropogenic extinctions can drastically alter the natural trajectory of biological communities, resulting in evolutionary disequilibrium. *L.M.

Moreover, illicit crop cultivation frequently takes place in biodiversity hotspots hosting a large number of species with a limited habitat, some of which are protected areas. It tends to occur close to the agricultural frontier, which demarcates the border between pristine forest and developed areas, and can result in the clearing of forests. Although empirical evidence and rigorous analy- sis do not support the claim that illicit cultivation is the major driver of deforestation, research does suggest that a lack of rural development drives the phenomenon. Analy- sis has shown, moreover, that drug trafficking can have a direct impact on deforestation through the construction of infrastructure such as landing strips and illegal roads, as well as indirectly through the privatization of public land to create “narco-estates”. When eradication induces a displacement of the location of drug crops it may result in deforestation as farmers react to eradication initiatives and seek places out of the reach of law enforcement. The disposal of chemicals used in the illicit manufacture of cocaine and opiates can also have negative consequences on the environment, contributing to pollution and health hazards in rural communities. In the case of synthetic drugs, the consequences in urban settings not only pose health risks but may also have an impact on the urban and industrial environment.","tags":["Marginal de la Selva","illicit crops","Colombia","Peru","Bolivia","Amazon-Andes","United Nations"],"title":"The world drug problem and sustainable development","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Miguel S.

Primates have an extensive, diverse fossil record and molecular data for living and extinct taxa are rapidly becoming available. We used two models to infer the phylogeny and divergence times for living and fossil primates, the tip-dating (TD) and fossilized birth–death process (FBD). We collected new morphological data, especially on the living and extinct endemic lemurs of Madagascar. We combined the morphological data with published DNA sequences to infer near-complete (88% of lemurs) time-calibrated phylogenies. The results suggest that primates originated around the Cretaceous–Tertiary boundary, slightly earlier than indicated by the fossil record and later than previously inferred from molecular data alone. We infer novel relationships among extinct lemurs, and strong support for relationships that were previously unresolved. Dates inferred with TD were significantly older than those inferred with FBD, most likely related to an assumption of a uniform branching process in the TD compared with a birth–death process assumed in the FBD. This is the first study to combine morphological and DNA sequence data from extinct and extant primates to infer evolutionary relationships and divergence times, and our results shed new light on the tempo of lemur evolution and the efficacy of combined phylogenetic analyses.","tags":["Bayesian","phylogenetics","calibration","chronogram","primatology","total evidence","phylogeny","fossils"],"title":"Phylogeny and divergence times of lemurs inferred with recent and ancient fossils in the tree","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Liliana M.

Support for the influence of period-specific changes on diversification often rests on detecting more speciation events during a particular period. The timing of speciation events may reflect the influence of incomplete taxon sampling, protracted speciation, and null processes of lineage accumulation. Here we assess the influence of these factors on the timing of speciation with new multilocus data for New World noctilionoid bats (Chiroptera Noctilionoidea). Biogeographic analyses revealed the importance of the Neotropics in noctilionoid diversification, and the critical role of dispersal. We detected no shift in speciation rate associated with the Quaternary or pre-Quaternary periods, and instead found an increase in speciation linked to the evolution of the subfamily Stenodermatinae (∼18 Ma). Simulations modeling constant speciation and extinction rates for the phylogeny systematically showed more speciation events in the Quaternary. Since recording more divergence events in the Quaternary can result from lineage accumulation, the age of extant sister species cannot be interpreted as supporting higher speciation rates during this period. Instead, analyzing the factors that influence speciation requires modeling lineage-specific traits and environmental, spatial, and ecological drivers of speciation.","tags":["fossils","geographic range evolution","Neotropics","Phyllostomidae","speciation","Noctilionoidea","phylogenetics","phylogeny","diversification","Bayesian phylogenetics"],"title":"Bats (Chiroptera: Noctilionoidea) Challenge a Recent Origin of Extant Neotropical Diversity","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Laurel R.

We developed Bayesian models to infer skull length based on dental measurements.

Here, we examine the conversion of forests to pastures and coca crops (illicit activity) on the San Lucas Mountain Range, Colombia for 2002–2007 and 2007–2010. Land use maps and biophysical variables were used as inputs to generate land use and cover change (LUCC) models using the DINAMICA EGO software. These analyses revealed a dramatic acceleration of the pace of deforestation in the region, with rates of conversion from forest to pasture doubling from the first to the second period. Altitude, distance to other crops, and distance to rivers were the primary drivers of deforestation. The influence of these drivers, however, differed markedly depending on whether coca cultivation or pastures replaced forest. Conversion to coca was more probable farther from other crops and from settlements. In contrast, proximity to other crops and to settlements increased conversion to pasture. These relationships highlight the different roles of coca and pastures in forest loss, with coca tending to open up new forest frontiers, and pastures tending to consolidate agricultural expansion and urban influence. Large differences between LUCC processes for each period suggest highly dynamic changes, likely associated with shifting underlying causes of deforestation. These changes may relate to shifts in demand for illicit crops, land, or mining products; however, the data to test these hypotheses are currently lacking. More frequent and detailed monitoring is required to guide actions to decrease the loss of forest in this highly vulnerable biodiversity hotspot in the Northern Andes.","tags":["Andean forest","deforestation","Andes","San Lucas","direct factors","underlying factors","illicit crops","Bayesian"],"title":"A Bayesian Spatial Model Highlights Distinct Dynamics in Deforestation from Coca and Pastures in an Andean Biodiversity Hotspot","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Romain A.

Insects of the sub-order Sternorrhyncha (Hemiptera) depend on bacterial endosymbionts for essential amino acids present at low abundances in their phloem-based diet. This obligate dependency has been proposed to explain why multiple amino acid transporter genes are maintained in the genomes of the insect hosts. We implemented phylogenetic comparative methods to test whether amino acid transporters have proliferated in sternorrhynchan genomes at rates grater than expected by chance. By applying a series of methods to reconcile gene and species trees, inferring the size of gene families in ancestral lineages, and simulating the null process of birth and death in multi-gene families, we uncovered a 10-fold increase in duplication rate in the AAAP family of amino acid transporters within Sternorrhyncha. This gene family expansion was unmatched in other closely related clades lacking endosymbionts that provide essential amino acids. Our findings support the influence of obligate endosymbioses on host genome evolution by both inferring significant expansions of gene families involved in symbiotic interactions, and discovering increases in the rate of duplication associated with multiple emergences of obligate symbiosis in Sternorrhyncha.

Two groups that deviate markedly from this pattern are bats and African mole-rats, with members of both groups being extremely long-lived given their body size, with the maximum documented lifespan for many species exceeding 20 years. A recent genomics study of the exceptionally long-lived Brandt's bat, Myotis brandtii (41 years), suggested that its longevity and small body size may be at least partly attributed to key amino acid substitutions in the transmembrane domains of the receptors of growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1). However, whereas elevated longevity is likely to be common across all 19 bat families, the reported amino acid substitutions were only observed in two closely related bat families. To test the hypothesis that an altered GH/IGF1 axis relates to the longevity of African mole-rats and bats, we compared and analysed the homologous coding gene sequences in genomic and transcriptomic data from 26 bat species, five mole-rats and 38 outgroup species. Phylogenetic analyses of both genes recovered the majority of nodes in the currently accepted species tree with high support. Compared to other clades, such as primates and carnivores, the bats and rodents had longer branch lengths. The single 24 amino acid transmembrane domain of IGF1R was found to be more conserved across mammals compared to that of GHR. Within bats, considerable variation in the transmembrane domain of GHR was found, including a previously unreported deletion in Emballonuridae. The transmembrane domains of rodents were found to be more conserved, with mole-rats lacking uniquely conserved amino acid substitutions. Molecular evolutionary analyses showed that both genes were under purifying selection in bats and mole-rats. Our findings suggest that while the previously documented mutations may confer some additional lifespan to Myotis bats, other, as yet unknown, genetic differences are likely to account for the long lifespans observed in many bat and mole-rat species.","tags":["mammal","bats","mole-rats","longevity","transmembrane domains","dN/dS","Evolutionary genetics","adaptation"],"title":"Molecular evolution of growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptors in long-lived, small-bodied mammals","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1409011200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1409011200,"objectID":"3ee0f3c0b8761e969a43a9782009f3e4","permalink":"/project/discovering_genomic_and_developmental_mechanisms/","publishdate":"2014-08-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/discovering_genomic_and_developmental_mechanisms/","section":"project","summary":"Data available to new students.

The combination of distance- and topology-based criteria will incur false-positive error rates well above 5% when ancestral effective population sizes are large and when population structure has been in place for 10,000 years or more. This effect persists even with a subtle bias in dispersal of 1 : 4 female : males dispersing in each generation. High false-positive error rates in genetic distances can be overcome by correcting for within-population sequence divergence.

If characters are independent and free of systematic errors, then combining as many different kinds of characters as are available will result in the best-supported phylogenetic hypotheses. But since morphological characters are subject to natural selection for function and arise from the expression of developmental pathways, they may not be independent, a situation that may amplify any underlying homoplasy. Here, we use new dental and multi-locus genetic data from bats (Mammalia: Chiroptera) to quantify saturation and similarity in morphological characters and introduce two likelihood-based approaches to identify strongly conflicting characters and integrate morphological and molecular data. We implement these methods to analyze the phylogeny of incomplete Miocene fossils in the radiation of Phyllostomidae (New World Leaf-nosed Bats), perhaps the most ecologically diverse family of living mammals. Morphological characters produced trees incongruent with molecular phylogenies, were saturated, and showed rates of change higher than most molecular substitution rates. Dental characters encoded variation similar to that in other morphological characters, while molecular characters encoded highly dissimilar variation in comparison. Saturation and high rates of change indicate randomization of phylogenetic signal in the morphological data, and extensive similarity suggests characters are non-independent and errors are amplified. To integrate the morphological data into tree building while accounting for homoplasy, we used statistical molecular scaffolds and combined phylogenetic analyses excluding a small subset of strongly conflicting dental characters. The phylogenies revealed the Miocene nectar-feeding †Palynephyllum nests within the crown nectar-feeding South American subfamily Lonchophyllinae, while the Miocene genus †Notonycteris is sister to the extant carnivorous Vampyrum.

Intriguing patterns of host genome evolution, including remarkable numbers of gene duplications, have been observed in the pea aphid, a sap‐feeding insect that relies on a bacterial endosymbiont for amino acid provisioning. Previously, we proposed that gene duplication has been important for the evolution of symbiosis based on aphid‐specific gene duplication in amino acid transporters (AATs), with some paralogs highly expressed in the cells housing symbionts (bacteriocytes). Here, we use a comparative approach to test the role of gene duplication in enabling recruitment of AATs to bacteriocytes. Using genomic and transcriptomic data, we annotate AATs from sap‐feeding and non sap‐feeding insects and find that, like aphids, AAT gene families have undergone independent large‐scale gene duplications in three of four additional sap‐feeding insects. RNA‐seq differential expression data indicate that, like aphids, the sap‐feeding citrus mealybug possesses several lineage‐specific bacteriocyte‐enriched paralogs. Further, differential expression data combined with quantitative PCR support independent evolution of bacteriocyte enrichment in sap‐feeding insect AATs. Although these data indicate that gene duplication is not necessary to initiate host/symbiont amino acid exchange, they support a role for gene duplication in enabling AATs to mediate novel host/symbiont interactions broadly in the sap‐feeding suborder Sternorrhyncha. In combination with recent studies on other symbiotic systems, gene duplication is emerging as a general pattern in host genome evolution.","tags":["aphid","bacteriocyte","functional evolution","gene duplication","mealybug","sap-feeding insect","phylogeny","Bayesian phylogenetics"],"title":"Dynamic recruitment of amino acid transporters to the insect/symbiont interface","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Liliana M.

Two dominant hypotheses explain this process. First, according to the hamburger connection beef markets promote conversion of forests into cattle ranches resulting in deforestation. Second, the land-as-wealth hypothesis explains deforestation as the result of land appreciation in forest frontiers. We tested these hypotheses using land use and socioeconomic data from northwestern Amazonia from 2000 to 2009. We also investigated two key control variables: coca cultivation and eradication, both of which have been proposed as important drivers of forest loss. We found high rate of conversion from forest to pasture, and unimpeded forest fragmentation. As predicted by the hamburger connection, pastures expanded as the cattle inventory grew. Beef demand did not drive pasture expansion, as ranching revenues declined and beef prices were roughly stable. Coca cultivation did not respond to the eradication campaign, and declined as the population became increasingly urbanized. We propose that investment on roads has enhanced the anticipated value of land. Cattle bolster land claims and can be used as financial collateral, so they have inherent value even without market exchange. Cattle can then increase despite stable beef prices and declining ranching revenues. To protect biodiversity, policy interventions that enhance the value of standing forests are needed to slow deforestation and fragmentation in these rapidly changing landscapes.","tags":["Amazon","hamburger connection","land as wealth","livestock","cattle ranching","Colombia"],"title":"Demand for beef is unrelated to pasture expansion in northwestern Amazonia","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sara Hayden","Michaël Bekaert","Alisha Goodbla","William J.

To investigate these relationships, we tested the fit of Brownian motion and Ornstein–Uhlenbeck models of evolution in mechanical advantage and von Mises stress using dated multilocus phylogenies. The analyses revealed three performance optima for mechanical advantage among species from three adaptive zones: bats that eat nectar; generalized insectivores, omnivores and some frugivores; and bats that specialize on hard canopy fruits. Only two optima, one corresponding to nectar feeding, were consistently uncovered for von Mises stress.

These hypotheses, however, have not been tested against a null model of climate‐driven postglacial area loss. Here, we use a new Quaternary mammal database and deep‐sea bathymetry to estimate species–area relationships (SARs) at present and during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) for bats of the Caribbean, and to model species loss as a function of area loss from rising sea level. Island area was a significant predictor of species richness in the Bahamas, Greater Antilles, and Lesser Antilles at all time periods, except for the Lesser Antilles during the LGM. Parameters of LGM and current SARs were similar in the Bahamas and Greater Antilles, but not the Lesser Antilles, which had fewer estimated species during the LGM than expected given their size. Estimated postglacial species losses in the Bahamas and Greater Antilles were largely explained by inferred area loss from rising sea level in the Holocene. However, there were more species in the Bahamas at present, and fewer species in the smaller Greater Antilles, than expected given island size and the end‐Pleistocene/early Holocene SARs. Poor fossil sampling and ecological factors may explain these departures from the null. Our analyses illustrate the importance of changes in area in explaining patterns of species richness through time and emphasize the role of the SAR as a null hypothesis in explorations of the impact of novel ecological interactions on extinction.","tags":["climate change","deglaciation","glaciation","sea-level rise","species-area relationship","extinction","island biogeography","fossils"],"title":"Deglaciation explains bat extinction in the Caribbean","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Liliana M.

However, differential rates of change and the evolutionary mechanisms driving those rates result in pervasive phylogenetic conflict. These drivers need to be uncovered because mismatches between evolutionary processes and phylogenetic models can lead to high confidence in incorrect hypotheses. Incongruence between phylogenies derived from morphological versus molecular analyses, and between trees based on different subsets of molecular sequences has become pervasive as datasets have expanded rapidly in both characters and species. For more than a decade, evolutionary relationships among members of the New World bat family Phyllostomidae inferred from morphological and molecular data have been in conflict. Here, we develop and apply methods to minimize systematic biases, uncover the biological mechanisms underlying phylogenetic conflict, and outline data requirements for future phylogenomic and morphological data collection. We introduce new morphological data for phyllostomids and outgroups and expand previous molecular analyses to eliminate methodological sources of phylogenetic conflict such as taxonomic sampling, sparse character sampling, or use of different algorithms to estimate the phylogeny. We also evaluate the impact of biological sources of conflict: saturation in morphological changes and molecular substitutions, and other processes that result in incongruent trees, including convergent morphological and molecular evolution. Methodological sources of incongruence play some role in generating phylogenetic conflict, and are relatively easy to eliminate by matching taxa, collecting more characters, and applying the same algorithms to optimize phylogeny. The evolutionary patterns uncovered are consistent with multiple biological sources of conflict, including saturation in morphological and molecular changes, adaptive morphological convergence among nectar‐feeding lineages, and incongruent gene trees. Applying methods to account for nucleotide sequence saturation reduces, but does not completely eliminate, phylogenetic conflict. We ruled out paralogy, lateral gene transfer, and poor taxon sampling and outgroup choices among the processes leading to incongruent gene trees in phyllostomid bats. Uncovering and countering the possible effects of introgression and lineage sorting of ancestral polymorphism on gene trees will require great leaps in genomic and allelic sequencing in this species‐rich mammalian family. We also found evidence for adaptive molecular evolution leading to convergence in mitochondrial proteins among nectar‐feeding lineages. In conclusion, the biological processes that generate phylogenetic conflict are ubiquitous, and overcoming incongruence requires better models and more data than have been collected even in well‐studied organisms such as phyllostomid bats.","tags":["convergence","incongruence","gene trees","partitioned likelihood support","phylogenetics","phylogeny","Phyllostomidae","saturation","species trees","systematic error","Bayesian phylogenetics"],"title":"Understanding phylogenetic incongruence: lessons from phyllostomid bats","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Angelique P.

We also present the i rst complete list of all its extant and extinct mammals. The mammalian biota is older than was earlier presumed, with many ancient endemic lineages, even among highly vagile organisms such as bats. Land bridges, Cenozoic eustatic sea-level changes, and Pleistocene glacial cycles have been proposed to explain the colonization of the islands, but phylogenetic divergence analyses often conflict with the timing of these events and favor alternative biogeographic histories. The loss of West Indian biodiversity is incompletely understood, but new radiometric chronologies indicate that anthropogenic impacts rather than glacial-interglacial environmental changes are responsible for most Quaternary extinction and extirpation events involving land mammals. However, many outstanding questions of historical biogeography remain unresolved, including appropriate methods for interpreting phylogenies and divergence estimates in a biogeographic context, and whether to use vicariance or dispersal as the null hypothesis when investigating regional patterns of colonization, speciation, and extinction in comparative analyses.

However, there are few empirical examples of how ecological opportunity and morphological innovation open new adaptive zones, and promote diversification. We analyse data on diet, skull morphology and bite performance, and relate these traits to diversification rates throughout the evolutionary history of an ecologically diverse family of mammals (Chiroptera: Phyllostomidae). We found a significant increase in diversification rate driven by increased speciation at the most recent common ancestor of the predominantly frugivorous subfamily Stenodermatinae. The evolution of diet was associated with skull morphology, and morphology was tightly coupled with biting performance, linking phenotype to new niches through performance. Following the increase in speciation rate, the rate of morphological evolution slowed, while the rate of evolution in diet increased. This pattern suggests that morphology stabilized, and niches within the new adaptive zone of frugivory were filled rapidly, after the evolution of a new cranial phenotype that resulted in a certain level of mechanical efficiency. The tree-wide speciation rate increased non linearly with a more frugivorous diet, and was highest at measures of skull morphology associated with morphological extremes, including the most derived Stenodermatines. These results show that a novel stenodermatine skull phenotype played a central role in the evolution of frugivory and increasing speciation within phyllostomids.","tags":["diversification","morphological innovation","bats","frugivory","Phyllostomidae","Stenodermatinae","trophic level","phylogenetic regression","phylogeny","Bayesian phylogenetics"],"title":"Morphological innovation, diversification and invasion of a new adaptive zone","type":"publication"},{"authors":["R.

Instead, the presence of new coca cultivation was an indicator of municipalities, where increasing population led to higher deforestation rates.

The methods of refuge biogeography helped shape early conservation priorities in Amazonia, although actual plans did not directly depend on the conceptual strengths or weaknesses of refugia biogeography. These approaches viewed people mostly as threats, though not always explicitly. Based on his work on primate distribution, Márcio Ayres formulated a synthetic speciation theory, the river-refuge hypothesis. The river-refuge model successfully resolved some of the historical and technical challenges of the earlier hypotheses. His work in várzea conservation, informed by this conceptual breakthrough, recognized that the maintenance of processes is at least as important as species numbers in prioritizing action. The work of Márcio Ayres broadened the scope of conservation in Amazonia by moving beyond the model of people-as-threats, and this was as great a conceptual contribution to conservation as anyone could make.","tags":["refugia","river-refuge","speciation","connectivity","conservation","Amazon"],"title":"The river-refuge hypothesis and other contributions of Márcio Ayres to conservation science","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Liliana M.

Methods New mitochondrial cytochrome b and nuclear Rag2 sequences were combined with published molecular data to estimate phylogenetic relationships and sequence divergence among Short‐faced bats. The resulting phylogenies were compared with those compatible with the single‐origin hypothesis using two model‐based statistical tests. Confidence limits on sequence divergence were estimated using a parametric bootstrap. Results All molecular phylogenies revealed two independent Caribbean lineages and showed that continental Short‐faced bats share a recent common ancestor. Morphology‐based trees compatible with the single‐origin hypothesis were significantly worse at explaining the molecular data than any molecular phylogeny. Main conclusions The ancestor of all Short‐faced bats reached the Antilles in the Miocene, too recently to have used a proposed Oligocene land bridge, and well before the Pleistocene glaciations that are thought to have facilitated dispersal for many bats. After a long period of isolation, Short‐faced bats diversified quickly on the Caribbean islands. A single Short‐faced lineage then reached the continent and subsequently expanded its range and diversified into the four extant genera. Among bats, independent lineages of aerial insectivores and nectarivores have also recolonized the continent after evolving in the West Indies.

The ecosystem function of these natural habitats benefits millions of Colombians who depend on their water, wood, bushmeat, and medicinal plants (Rodríguez \u0026 Ponce, 1999). Over several centuries, the advance of the agricultural frontier has fragmented these ecosystems resulting in the extirpation of endemic species, natural disasters, and a general decline in environmental quality, particularly in the Andes and the Caribbean region (Cavelier \u0026 Etter, 1995; Cavelier et al., 1998; Etter \u0026 van Wyngarden, 2000). Over the last decade, however, incentives for agricultural production in Colombia have decreased. The output of annual crops fell at an average annual rate of 3.2%, agricultural production lost 4% of its relative importance in the GDP, and agricultural imports have increased almost 10-fold (Jaramillo, 2001; Robledo, 1999; Vásquez, 1997). Nonetheless, the fragmentation of natural ecosystems persists partly because of the expansion of other legal economic activities—perennial crops, cattle ranching, mining, and timber exploitation—as well as that of illicit crops whose exponential growth has paralleled the escalation of armed conflict (Álvarez, 2001, 2003).","tags":["environmental damage","crime prevention","armed group","Andean forest","deforestation"],"title":"Environmental damage from illicit drug crops in Colombia","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Liliana M.

Research on the origin and diversification of island biotas is particularly appealing because these have inspired classical models in biogeography. This study examined competing explanations of Caribbean historical biogeography: an Oligocene land bridge between northern South America and the West Indies, and Cenozoic dispersal from South America and/or Central America. Separate and combined phylogenetic analyses were conducted using new molecular data and published morphological characters for five monophyletic bat lineages; Mormoops, Pteronotus, a clade comprising Brachyphylla, Erophylla, and Phyllonycteris, the subtribe Stenodermatina, and Natalidae. The resulting phylogenies were analyzed using event-based biogeographic methods, synthesized into hypotheses of area relationships, and used to generate estimates of divergence times at critical nodes. The phylogenies of three of the five lineages are congruent with a single range expansion onto the Caribbean, whereas Mormoops is also consistent with this result but further studies of fossil remains are necessary, and Antillean Pteronotus appears to be a product of at least two separate invasions. Continental Stenodermatina and Natalidae descended from Caribbean ancestors. The ancestral areas of all the lineages are Mexico, Central America, and northern South America. The patterns of area relationships derived from phylogenies are equivocal in their support for the land bridge hypothesis. The ages of the bat lineages appear to be too young to have used an Oligocene land bridge. Instead, lowering and rising sea levels at key transitions during the Miocene may have facilitated the spread, and subsequent isolation, of the bat lineages leading to diversification and shared biogeographic pattern. The role of the Miocene in Caribbean biogeographic history should be tested with additional phylogenies, new molecular data, as well as the fossil record. The correlation of geological history, phylogenetic patterns, and the timing of diversification in bats demonstrates congruent biogeographic patterns in the Caribbean are pervasive even among the most vagile organisms.","tags":["extinction","Caribbean","West Indies","Antilles","dispersal","vicariance","Bayesian phylogenetics","phylogenetics"],"title":"Historical biogeography of the Antilles: Earth history and phylogenetics of endemic chiropteran taxa","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Liliana M.

Of these, megalocnine sloths, hystricognath rodents, Brachyphylla and allied bats, Stenodermatina bats, and primates fit the pattern of divergence from the mainland implied by the Gaarlandia hypothesis. Sloths, rodents and primates also roughly fit the timing of arrival to the Caribbean implied by Gaarlandia. The remaining taxa show contradictory dates of divergence according to molecular clock estimates, and no taxa fit the predicted timing and pattern of divergence among Antillean landmasses under the Gaarlandia model.

Results show that guerrillas and/or paramilitaries range throughout areas of human encroachment into remnant forests. The policies promoted by Colombia's irregular armed forces range from “gunpoint conservation” rarely applied by guerrillas, to the rapid conversion of forests and crops to cattle ranches and coca (Erythroxylum sp.) plantations, following paramilitary occupation.

We examine regulations and agreements in Brazil, Colombia, and the Philippines in detail and discuss how these countries are implementing the AGR mandate. In particular, we evaluate progress toward achieving the CBD objectives of conserving biological diversity, using its components in a sustainable manner, and equitably sharing the benefits arising from the use of genetic resources. We highlight the difficulties in developing and implementing these policies, arising from the conflicting goals of regulating and facilitating AGR, as well as the special character of genetic resources, existing ex situ collections, issues of ownership and tenure, and the dearth of legal, institutional, and scientific capacity in many countries. We recommend (1) independent, multidisciplinary evaluation of the success of the access policy in achieving CBD objectives, (2) resolution of the conflict between traditional land tenure and legal property rights of genetic resources so as to match conservation obligations with benefit-sharing rights, (3) recognition that benefits obtained from AGR may be entirely non-monetary, and (4) that countries provide a 'two-track’ AGR application process separately for commercial and non-commercial users.","tags":["Andean Pact","Biodiversity","Bioprospecting","Brazil","Colombia","Convention on Biological Diversity","Genetic resources","International environmental law","Legislation","Philippines"],"title":"Regulating access to genetic resources under the Convention on Biological Diversity: an analysis of selected case studies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Liliana M.

Historical changes in the Colombian landscape have been dramatic, but the magnitude and rate of change has increased over the last half century, while conflict has consumed the capacity of Colombian society to respond to environmental threats. Academic experts in the study of the Colombian conflict have explored the social, political, and economic implications of the war. However, the environmental consequences of conflict are documented only when groups in conflict target salient economic resources. This paper presents the first analysis of the geographic distribution of forest remnants in relation to armed conflict in Colombia. Results show that guerrillas and/or paramilitaries range throughout areas of human encroachment into remnant forests. The policies promoted by Colombia's irregular armed forces range from “gunpoint conservation” rarely applied by guerrillas, to the rapid conversion of forests and crops to cattle ranches and coca (Erythroxylum sp.) plantations, following paramilitary occupation. Because the rates and extent of fragmentation are linked to such land use practices, armed groups may play a crucial role in determining the fate of Colombia's forests and their endemic biota.","tags":["gunpoint conservation","illicit crops","violence syndrome","deforestation"],"title":"Forests in the Time of Violence; Conservation Implications of the Colombian War","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Liliana M.

I conducted a geographic analysis of the distribution of illicit crops relative to standing forests and areas of conservation priority for birds. Municipalities where illicit crops have been detected were overlaid on a forest‐cover map of Colombia and two types of conservation priorities for birds were plotted: distributions of threatened species and minimum‐area sets for conservation of all species. The sites of the highest conservation priority affected by illicit crops were in the southern Andes, the northern West Andes and adjacent Darién lowlands, the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, Serranía del Perijá, and the Serranía de San Lucas. The largest forested areas threatened by illicit crops were in Amazonia and the Amazonian foothills of the East Andes, sites of low conservation priority. Given current trends in the expansion of illicit crops and the narrow endemicity of some bird species, the conversion of forests for illicit‐crop cultivation may result in the extirpation of several bird species from affected regions. To impede this, those involved in illicit‐crop eradication and alternative development should give high priority to the protection of existing forest reserves and parks from the planting of illicit crops. Such efforts should also extend to areas proposed for conservation based on the diversity of threatened and endemic birds that are currently unprotected. The conservation of threatened and endemic birds in Colombian forests may hinge on successfully curbing incentives for deforestation, including the international trade in illicit drugs.","tags":["protected areas","aves","illicit crops"],"title":"Illicit Crops and Bird Conservation Priorities in Colombia","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Liliana M.

The few cases of direct intervention by multinational corporations at international fora suggest their interests are expressed elsewhere. The authors identify and discuss three types of intervention in the existing forest regime: avoidance, enforcement-driven compliance, and performance-driven compliance. The regime has not achieved performance-driven compliance from multinational corporations because the regime itself is weak and has little support from states internationally and domestically. The authors suggest that multinational corporations have been so effective at avoiding or conditioning compliance that incentives for complying fully with the regime are nil.","tags":["deforestation","United Nations","multinational corporations"],"title":"Missing the Forest for the Profits: The Role of Multinational Corporations in the International Forest Regime","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Liliana M.

Through its socioeconomic effects violent conflict can result in threats pertinent to both conservation and resource management schemes. A survey of the San Lucas mountain range, at the northern tip of the Colombian Central Andes, is presented as a case study of factors associated with violent conflict that may hinder or enhance conservation in this complex social and political setting. Instability in land use and tenure associated with armed conflict were identified as major pressures associated with further conversion of tropical forest habitats; while low rates of settlement and measures enforced by armed rule were very effective in preserving certain tracts of forest. War certainly alleviates demographic pressure from settlers, but contemporary patterns of colonization in San Lucas suggest that armed conflict is detrimental to conservation purposes and to key members of the biological community.","tags":["Colombia","deforestation","armed conflict","war","gold mining","Andes","San Lucas"],"title":"The San Lucas mountain range in Colombia how much conservation is owed to the violence?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Liliana M.
