Yet, they do not always appreciate that these ecosystems are in fact palimpsests shaped by multiple human cultures over millennia. Although post-European anthropogenic impacts are well documented, human influx into the region began about 5000 years prior. Thus, inferences of ecological and evolutionary processes within the Caribbean may in fact represent artifacts of an unrecognized human legacy linked to issues influenced by centuries of colonial rule. The threats posed by stochastic natural and anthropogenically influenced disasters demand that we have an understanding of the natural history of endemic species if we are to halt extinctions and maintain access to traditional livelihoods. However, systematic issues have significantly biased our biological knowledge of the Caribbean. We discuss two case studies of the Caribbean’s fragmented natural history collections and the effects of differing governance by the region’s multiple nation states. We identify knowledge gaps and highlight a dire need for integrated and accessible inventorying of the Caribbean’s collections. Research emphasizing local and international collaboration can lead to positive steps forward and will ultimately help us more accurately study Caribbean biodiversity and the ecological and evolutionary processes that generated it.","tags":["Caribbean","Antilles","extinction","Anthropocene","natural laboratories","environmental archeology","heterogenous histories","national identity","equitable science","collecting practices"],"title":"Colonial legacies influence biodiversity lessons: how past trade routes and power dynamics shape present-day scientific research and professional opportunities for Caribbean scientists","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"William Thomas won the American Genetic Association\u0026rsquo;s Evolutionary, Ecological, or Conservation Genomics Research Award!

Cross-references to the findings in the Executive Summary are indicated by {ES#}. Key Message 1: High levels of ambition for halting and reversing biodiversity loss (Goal A) cannot be met without transformative change which is a “fundamental, system-wide reorganization across technological, economic and social factors, including paradigms, goals and values, needed for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity, long- term human well-being and sustainable development” {ES1, ES2}.\nKey Message 2: Achieving ambitious objectives for ecosystems, species and genetic diversity (Goal A) depends on a comprehensive portfolio of actions to reduce all of the direct threats to biodiversity from land and sea use change, direct exploitation of organisms, climate change, pollution, invasive alien species and their interactions {ES1, ES3}.\nKey Message 3: Global targets of the GBF provide an important template for action, but it is how these targets are implemented and how actions are coordinated across local, national and international levels that will determine success in achieving objectives for biodiversity. Regular assessments of the implementation of targets and their contributions to progress towards clearly defined goals and milestones for biodiversity are therefore vital elements of the GBF {ES4}.\nKey Message 4: Reversing biodiversity loss will require addressing threats to biodiversity in both natural and managed ecosystems, as well as the interconnections between them. “Natural” and “managed” ecosystems differ in their species and genetic composition, ecosystem functions and supply of benefits to people, hence the targets for action, reference states, monitoring requirements and relevant indicators differ between them {ES5}.\nKey Message 5: All dimensions of biodiversity — genetic, trait, population, species, community and ecosystem — show interlinked responses to human drivers. Efforts to mitigate the effects of drivers on one dimension (e.g., population abundances) will depend on action on other dimensions (e.g., genetic diversity). Knowledge of the interlinked relationships between dimensions of biodiversity can be used to guide prioritization for conservation {ES6}.\nKey Message 6: Ambitious action is needed as soon as possible and must be sustained over time if we are to put biodiversity on a trend to recovery by mid-century. There is good evidence that while some dimensions of biodiversity recover rapidly following conservation action, many show long-lasting, or time-delayed, changes in response to actions to mitigate the effects of drivers {ES7}.\nKey Message 7: The degree of biodiversity change, and relative importance of drivers, vary greatly across scales and from place to place, and drivers in one place can affect biodiversity far away in other places {ES8}.\nKey Message 8: Successful implementation of the GBF requires substantial investment in monitoring capacity to detect change and attribute drivers. There is a need to ensure the supply of, and access to, data that underpin the effective use of indicators to track progress and guide action needed to implement the GBF at local, national and international levels. The set of indicators for monitoring progress to Goal A of the GBF should be expanded to comprehensively cover outcomes, drivers and actions and the interdependencies between them {ES9}.","tags":["SBSTTA","Global Biodiversity Framework","conservation","biodiversity conservation","United Nations","Convention on Biological Diversity"],"title":"Transformative actions on all drivers of biodiversity loss are urgently required to achieve the global goals by 2050","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Liliana M.

Evaluating the effects of coca cultivation has become a priority because averting deforestation has become a priority to reduce carbon emissions in the Amazon. Here I use models of tropical deforestation, one based on immiserization and the other on frontier development, to evaluate the role of coca cultivation in land use change. While both models are consistent with deforestation by campesino smallholders, only the frontier model predicts infrastructure investment increases forest loss. Contrary to the assumption of previous studies relating deforestation to coca, deforestation rates tend to be lower in areas with coca cultivation in Colombia and Peru, with the reverse tendency in Bolivia. Probabilistic models of deforestation controlling for a series of confounding variables confirmed no tendency of coca cultivation to increase or decrease deforestation rates in Colombia. Additionally, analyses examining the relationship between coca cultivation and migration to the Colombian frontier failed to find a consistent relationship, implying illicit crops are not the cause of migration. Instead, deforestation traces back to mid twentieth-century state-sponsored roads and colonization projects that promoted mass migration to the frontier. In time, as investment and other support dwindled, campesinos turned to coca as a competitive cash crop.","tags":["Bolivia","Peru","Colombia","illicit crops","development","Marginal de la Selva","Amazon","Amazon-Andes"],"title":"Los fantasmas del desarrollo pasado.

Many instructors fear that devoting time to process skills will detract from content gains and struggle to define CT skills in ways relevant for classroom practice. We tested an approach to develop and assess CT in undergraduate conservation biology courses using case studies to address both challenges. We developed case studies with exercises to support content learning goals and assessment rubrics to evaluate student learning of both content and CT skills. We also developed a midterm intervention to enhance student metacognitive abilities at a light and intensive level and asked whether the level of the intervention impacted student learning. Data from over 200 students from five institutions showed an increase in students’ CT performance over a single term, under both light and intensive interventions, as well as variation depending on the students’ initial performance and on rubric dimension. Our results demonstrate adaptable and scalable means for instructors to improve CT process skills among undergraduate students through the use of case studies and associated exercises, aligned rubrics, and supported reflection on their CT performance.","tags":["critical thinking","process skills","rubric","student learning"],"title":"Using Case Studies to Improve the Critical Thinking Skills of Undergraduate Conservation Biology Students","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Bats, forests, and life in science featured in long interview for Mongabay by Nicolás Bustamante .\n","date":1635465600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635465600,"objectID":"0a82cc871c42e34c6df4e8b0185668b8","permalink":"https://lmdavalos.github.io/post/21-10-29-liliana-mongabay/","publishdate":"2021-10-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/21-10-29-liliana-mongabay/","section":"post","summary":"Bats, forests, and life in science featured in long interview for Mongabay by Nicolás Bustamante .\n","tags":null,"title":"Liliana Dávalos featured in Mongabay!","type":"post"},{"authors":["Liliana M.

In the Andean region of South America, population growth has been a leading explanation for both deforestation and coca cultivation, but coca generates armed conflict and attracts counter-drug measures, obscuring the differences between population-driven and frontier-opening models of deforestation. Using a 15-year panel from Colombia, we model deforestation, coca cultivation, and conflict victims as interrelated responses with a suite of covariates encompassing land cover, land cover changes, population, population changes, counter-drug measures, and government infrastructure spending. Infrastructure spending suppresses coca, coca and eradication by aerial fumigation both increase conflict, and conflict promotes deforestation and is associated with depopulation. But the strongest predictor of deforestation is pasture growth, which covaries with coca. While these models show that infrastructure spending can help reduce coca, and coca’s influence on deforestation is indirect and mediated by conflict, the models also reveal the most important challenge to forest conservation is neither coca nor conflict, but an insatiable appetite for land that expresses itself through pasture growth.","tags":["Amazon-Andes","Colombia","development","infrastructure","coca","armed conflict","pastures"],"title":"Forests, Coca, and Conflict: Grass Frontier Dynamics and Deforestation in the Amazon-Andes","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lab \u0026amp; life partnership as well as new research featured in PBS Nova (go to min 7) by Raphaël Hitier .\n","date":1631664000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1631664000,"objectID":"d07254500c38eea8418a6be68327176b","permalink":"https://lmdavalos.github.io/post/21-09-15-liliana-nova/","publishdate":"2021-09-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/21-09-15-liliana-nova/","section":"post","summary":"Lab \u0026amp; life partnership as well as new research featured in PBS Nova (go to min 7) by Raphaël Hitier .\n","tags":null,"title":"Dávalos Lab featured on Nova!","type":"post"},{"authors":["Laurel R.

Chemosensation requires animals to decipher a complex chemical background to locate fitness-related resources, and thus the underlying genomic architecture and morphology must cope with constant exposure to a changing odorant landscape; detecting adaptation amidst extensive chemosensory diversity is an open challenge. Phyllostomid bats, an ecologically diverse clade that evolved plant-visiting from an insectivorous ancestor, suggests the evolution of novel food detection mechanisms is a key innovation: phyllostomids behaviorally rely strongly on olfaction, while echolocation is supplemental. If this is true, exceptional variation of underlying olfactory genes and phenotypes may have preceded dietary diversification. We compared olfactory receptor (OR) genes sequenced from olfactory epithelium transcriptomes and olfactory epithelium surface area of bats with differing diets. Surprisingly, although OR evolution rates were quite variable and generally high, they are largely independent of feeding ecology. olfactory epithelial surface area, however, is greater in plant-visiting bats and there is an inverse relationship between OR evolution rates and surface area. Larger surface areas suggest greater reliance on olfactory detection and stronger ecological constraint on maintaining an already diverse OR repertoire. Instead of the typical case in which specialization and elaboration is coupled with rapid diversification of associated genes, here the relevant genes are already evolving so quickly that increased reliance on smell has led to stabilizing selection, presumably to maintain the ability to consistently discriminate among specific odorants - an ecological constraint on sensory evolution.","tags":["transcriptomics","frugivory","morphology","allometry","Phyllostomidae","evolutionary genetics","gene family evolution","olfaction","olfactory receptors"],"title":"Ecological constraints on highly evolvable olfactory receptor genes and morphology","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Joshua Potter","Rosie Drinkwater","Kalina T.

In contrast, a few bat and bird species have convergently evolved to subsist on nectar, a sugar-rich mixture of glucose, fructose, and sucrose. How these nectar-feeders have adapted to cope with life-long high sugar intake while avoiding the onset of metabolic syndrome and diabetes is not understood. We analyzed gene sequences obtained from 127 taxa, including 22 nectar-feeding bat and bird genera that collectively encompass four independent origins of nectarivory. We show these divergent taxa have undergone pervasive molecular adaptation in sugar catabolism pathways, including parallel selection in key glycolytic and fructolytic enzymes. We also uncover convergent amino acid substitutions in the otherwise evolutionarily conserved aldolase B (ALDOB), which catalyzes rate-limiting steps in fructolysis and glycolysis, and the mitochondrial gatekeeper pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), which links glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Metabolomic profile and enzyme functional assays are consistent with increased respiratory flux in nectar-feeding bats and help explain how these taxa can both sustain hovering flight and efficiently clear simple sugars. Taken together, our results indicate that nectar-feeding bats and birds have undergone metabolic adaptations that have enabled them to exploit a unique energy-rich dietary niche among vertebrates.","tags":["transcriptomics","evolutionary genetics","metabolism","Phyllostomidae","positive selection","niche specialization","nectarivory","metabolomics","respiratory flux"],"title":"Nectar-Feeding Bats and Birds Show Parallel Molecular Adaptations in Sugar Metabolism Enzymes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dolors Armenteras","Liliana M.

Although 40.1% of forests (3,393,250 ha) burned only once, by 2018, ~48% of the evergreen forests converted to other, primarily grass-dominated uses. While greater fire frequency yielded more transformation, our results reveal the staggering impact of even a single fire. Increasing fire frequency imposes greater risks of irreversible forest loss, transforming forests into ecosystems increasingly vulnerable to degradation. Reversing this trend is indispensable to both mitigate and adapt to climate change globally.

Here, we test this hypothesis in a community of mutualistic, ecologically important neotropical bats (Carollia spp.) and plants (Piper spp.) that communicate primarily via chemical signals. We found greater bat consumption is significantly associated with scent chemical diversity and presence of specific compounds, which fit multi-peak selective regime models in Piper. Through behavioural assays, we found Carollia prefer certain compounds, particularly 2-heptanol, which evolved as a unique feature of two Piper species highly consumed by these bats. Thus, we demonstrate that volatile compounds emitted by neotropical Piper fruits evolved in tandem with seed dispersal by scent-oriented Carollia bats.

ORs evolve via gene duplication in a birth-death fashion, neofunctionalizing and pseudogenizing over time. Olfaction is a primary sense used for food detection in plant-visiting bats, but the relationship between dietary specialization and OR repertoire diversity is unclear. Within neotropical Leaf-nosed bats (Phyllostomidae), many lineages are plant specialists, and some have a distinct OR repertoire compared to insectivorous species. Yet, whether specialization on particular plant genera is associated with the evolution of specialized OR repertoires with narrower diversity has never been tested. Using targeted sequence capture, we sequenced the OR repertoires of three sympatric species of short-tailed fruit bats (Carollia), which vary in their degree of specialization on the fruits of Piper plants. We characterized orthologous versus duplicated receptors among Carollia species, and explored the diversity and redundancy of the receptor gene repertoire. At the species level, the most dedicated Piper specialist, Carollia castanea, had lower OR diversity compared to the two generalists (C. sowelli, C. perspicillata), but we discovered a few unique sets of ORs within C. castanea with high redundancy of similar gene duplicates. These unique receptors potentially enable C. castanea to detect Piper fruit odorants better than its two congeners. Carollia perspicillata, the species with the most generalist diet, had a higher diversity of intact receptors, suggesting the ability to detect a wider range of odorant molecules. Variation among ORs may be a factor in the coexistence of these sympatric species, facilitating the exploitation of different plant resources. Our study sheds light on how gene duplication and changes in OR diversity may play a role in dietary adaptations and underlies patterns of ecological interactions between bats and plants.","tags":["genomics","Phyllostomidae","evolutionary genetics","gene family evolution","olfaction","olfactory receptors","gene duplication","Carollia","Piper","chemosensation"],"title":"Diversity in olfactory receptor repertoires is associated with dietary specialization in a genus of frugivorous bat","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Diana Moreno Santillan","Tanya Lama","Yocelyn Gutiérrez Guerrero","Alexis Brown","Paul Donat","Huabin Zhao","Stephen Rossiter","Laurel R.

Some of the molecular mechanisms underlying these unique adaptations includes DNA repair, metabolism and immunity. However, analyses have been limited to a few divergent lineages, reducing the scope of inferences on gene family evolution across the Order Chiroptera. We conducted an exhaustive comparative genomic study of 37 bat species, one generated in this study, encompassing a large number of lineages, with a particular emphasis on multi-gene family evolution across immune and metabolic genes. In agreement with previous analyses, we found lineage-specific expansions of the APOBEC3 and MHC-I gene families, and loss of the proinflammatory PYHIN gene family. We inferred more than 1,000 gene losses unique to bats, including genes involved in the regulation of inflammasome pathways such as epithelial defense receptors, the natural killer gene complex and the interferon-gamma induced pathway. Gene set enrichment analyses revealed genes lost in bats are involved in defense response against pathogen-associated molecular patterns and damage-associated molecular patterns. Gene family evolution and selection analyses indicate bats have evolved fundamental functional differences compared to other mammals in both innate and adaptive immune system, with the potential to enhance anti-viral immune response while dampening inflammatory signaling. In addition, metabolic genes have experienced repeated expansions related to convergent shifts to plant-based diets. Our analyses support the hypothesis that, in tandem with flight, ancestral bats had evolved a unique set of immune adaptations whose functional implications remain to be explored.","tags":["genomics","evolutionary genetics","gene family evolution","immune response","metabolism","gene duplication"],"title":"Large-Scale Genome Sampling Reveals Unique Immunity and Metabolic Adaptations in Bats","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Liliana M.

Here we investigate the relationship between the evolution of sensory structures and diet during the radiation of noctilionoid bats. With a broad range of foraging ecologies and a well- supported phylogeny, noctilionoids constitute an ideal group for studying this relationship. We used diffusible iodine-based contrast enhanced computed tomography (diceCT) scans of 44 noctilionoid species to analyze relationships between the relative volumes of three sensory structures (olfactory bulbs, orbits, and cochleae) and diet. We found a positive relationship between frugivory and both olfactory and orbit size. However, we also found a negative relationship between nectarivory and cochlea size. Ancestral state estimates suggest that larger orbits and olfactory bulbs were present in the common ancestor of family Phyllostomidae, but not in other noctilionoid. This constellation of traits indicates a shift toward omnivory at the base of Phyllostomidae, predating their radiation into an exceptionally broad range of dietary niches. This is consistent with a scenario in which changes in sensory systems associated with foraging and feeding set the stage for subsequent morphological modification and diversification.","tags":["Morphological evolution","3D morphometrics","Phyllostomidae","Noctilionoidea","olfactory bulb","orbit","cochlea"],"title":"Find the Food First: An Omnivorous Sensory Morphotype Predates Biomechanical Specialization for Plant Based Diets in Phyllostomid Bats","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"William Thomas won the Society for Systematic Biologists' Graduate Student Research Award!

Whether or not active global conflicts are declining in number remains hotly debated, the number of countries entering post-conflict periods is on the rise, and the impact of this transition on land cover changes remains poorly understood. In Colombia, though large-scale armed conflict has concluded, the post-conflict period represents an ongoing threat to forest conservation, putting at risk commitments to meet global conservation goals and even those stipulated in the peace accord. This paper aims to assess land cover change associated with the Colombian conflict in the Andes- Amazon region between 1988 and 2019. First, we use the Landsat archive to map land cover and characterize the spatial patterns of change at the regional level. Second, to empirically identify the effect of conflict on land cover change, we employ a difference-in-difference approach using local conflict events data. During conflict (1988–2011), land cover in the Andes-Amazon remained relatively stable, however during the post-conflict period (2012–2019), the conversion from forest to agriculture increased by 40%. We find that forest cover surrounding conflict events (1 km radius) decreased significantly, on average by ~ 19% during conflict, which accelerated to ~ 30% in the post-conflict period. Similarly, agriculture expansion is most substantial during the post-conflict period, but exclusively in municipalities with population below the 50th percentile.

However, correlates of risk can be nonlinear, within-species risk varies geographically, and current-day threats cannot reveal drivers of past losses. We investigated factors that regulated survival or extinction in Caribbean mammals, which have experienced the globally highest level of human-caused postglacial mammalian extinctions, and included all extinct and extant Holocene island populations of non-volant species (219 survivals or extinctions across 118 islands). Extinction selectivity shows a statistically detectable and complex body mass effect, with survival probability decreasing for both mass extremes, indicating that intermediate-sized species have been more resilient. A strong interaction between mass and age of first human arrival provides quantitative evidence of larger mammals going extinct on the earliest islands colonized, revealing an extinction filter caused by past human activities. Survival probability increases on islands with lower mean elevation (mostly small cays acting as offshore refugia) and decreases with more frequent hurricanes, highlighting the risk of extreme weather events and rising sea levels to surviving species on low-lying cays. These findings demonstrate the interplay between intrinsic biology, regional ecology and specific local threats, providing insights for understanding drivers of biodiversity loss across island systems and fragmented habitats worldwide.","tags":["phylogenetics","Bayesian","Caribbean","Antilles","extinction","Anthropocene"],"title":"Where the wild things were: intrinsic and extrinsic extinction predictors in the world's most depleted mammal fauna","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marisa C.W.

In montane systems, where species are often restricted to narrow ranges of elevation, it is unclear whether selection is strong enough to influence functional differentiation of subpopulations differing by a few hundred meters in elevation. We used targeted capture of 12,501 exons from across the genome, including 271 genes previously implicated in altitude adaptation, to test for adaptation to local elevations for two highland hummingbird species, Coeligena violifer (n=62) and Colibri coruscans (n=101). For each species, we described population genetic structure across the complex geography of the Peruvian Andes and, while accounting for this structure, we tested whether elevational allele-frequency clines in single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) showed evidence for local adaptation to elevation. Although the two species exhibited contrasting population genetic structures, we found signatures of clinal genetic variation with shifts in elevation in both. The genes with SNP-elevation associations included candidate genes previously discovered for high-elevation adaptation as well as others not previously identified, with cellular functions related to hypoxia response, energy metabolism, and immune function, among others. Despite the homogenizing effects of gene flow and genetic drift, natural selection on parts of the genome evidently optimizes elevation-specific cellular function even within elevation range-restricted montane populations. Consequently, our results suggest local adaptation occurring in narrow elevation bands in tropical mountains, such as the Andes, may effectively make them “taller” biogeographic barriers.","tags":["evolutionary genetics","bait capture","adaptation","SNPs","Andes","hummingbirds","metabolism"],"title":"Pervasive genomic signatures of local adaptation to altitude across highland specialist Andean hummingbird populations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Joshua Potter","Kalina T.

Among mammals, Neotropical leaf-nosed bats (family Phyllostomidae) show unmatched diversity in diet; from a putative insectivorous ancestor, phyllostomids have radiated to specialize on diverse food sources, including blood, nectar, and fruit. To assess whether dietary diversification in this group was accompanied by molecular adaptations for changing metabolic demands, we sequenced 89 transcriptomes across 58 species, and combined these with published data to compare ∼13,000 protein coding genes across 66 species. We tested for positive selection on focal lineages, including those inferred to have undergone dietary shifts. Unexpectedly, we found a broad signature of positive selection in the ancestral phyllostomid branch, spanning genes implicated in the metabolism of all major macronutrients, yet few positively selected genes at the inferred switch to plantivory. Branches corresponding to blood- and nectar-based diets showed selection in loci underpinning nitrogenous waste excretion and glycolysis, respectively. Intriguingly, patterns of selection in metabolism genes were mirrored by those in loci implicated in craniofacial remodelling, a trait previously linked to phyllostomid dietary specialisation. Finally, using simulations, we show that the widely-used branch-site model is likely to be misspecified, with the implication that it is too conservative and probably under-reports true cases of positive selection. Our findings point to a complex picture of adaptive radiation, in which the evolution of new dietary specialisations has been facilitated by early adaptations combined with the generation of new genetic variation.","tags":["transcriptomics","evolutionary genetics","metabolism","Phyllostomidae","positive selection","niche specialization","frugivory","excretion","preadaptation"],"title":"Dietary Diversification and Specialisation in New World Bats Facilitated by Early Molecular Evolution","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Anna McPherran won the Williams award at the 2021 Ecology \u0026amp; Evolution retreat.

However, many subfamilies share a similar insect-feeding morphotype, apparently stable over millions of generations. Is the diversity of phyllostomid traits adaptive, and does it contribute to species diversity in the family? We evaluate predictions from Simpson’s ecological theory of adaptive radiation, applied to comparative trait analyses since 2000. The shift to higher rates of taxonomic diversification at the base of Stenodermatinae, new skull architecture capable of great bite force despite small size, and a distinctive olfactory receptor profile make this subfamily a radiation by itself. The stenodermatine skull architecture also enables making leaf tents, a new roost adaptive zone that contributes to the diversity of this subfamily. The evolution of distinct trophic adaptive zones characterized by optima in cranial musculature and mechanical advantage shows that stenodermatines are not the only phyllostomid lineage responding to ecological opportunities. Instead, nectarivores have unique cranial traits and occupy their own trophic adaptive zone, while a subset of insectivores together with sanguivores share a similarly high trophic level. There is also evidence of convergent and adaptive evolution in cranial traits associated with similar trophic levels, as well as adaptations coupled with dietary specialization in digestive and renal function. While linked to higher rates of taxonomic diversification only among stenodermatines, these various adaptations demonstrate the response of phenotypic form to diverse ecological function that makes phyllostomid bats unique.","tags":["adaptive radiation","trophic level","Stenodermatinae","Phyllostomidae","Ornstein-Uhlenbeck","adaptation","diversification"],"title":"Adapt or Live: Adaptation, Convergent Evolution, and Plesiomorphy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Theodore H.

Family-wide genetic sequence data starting in the early 2000s, however, showed that this phylogeny obscured the taxonomy, biogeography, and evolution of ecological traits in the family. Current phylogenies strongly support the monophyly of 11 subfamilies, as well as most relationships among them. Nonetheless, the positions of several key groups are not well-supported and require further analyses, including: 1) Micronycterinae relative to Desmodontinae, 2) Lonchorhininae, and 3) the genus-level resolution of Miocene fossils. Historical biogeographic analyses have revealed a South American origin for most subfamilies; have inferred widespread and multi-continental distributions for ancient ancestors; and have rejected a special influence of Quaternary glaciations on recent speciation. These analyses have also confirmed North and Central America, as well as South America, as independent centers of diversification for some subfamilies (e.g., Macrotinae), as well as within subfamilies (e.g., Glossophaginae). These parallel centers of diversity might result from the absence of continuous dry habitat corridors between the continents, but this hypothesis has not been tested using phyloclimatic methods. Biogeographic analyses of individual genera have demonstrated the importance of the Andes for diversification in Platyrrhinus, Sturnira, and Uroderma, as well as the critical role of humid forest corridors between Central and South America for the long-term dispersal of these lineages.","tags":["adaptive radiation","Miocene","Micronycterinae","Phyllostomidae","Desmodontinae","Lonchorhininae","diversification","historical biogeography"],"title":"Phylogenetics and Historical Biogeography","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Liliana M.

High-quality genomes are crucial for understanding the molecular basis and evolution of these traits. Here we incorporated long-read sequencing and state-of-the-art scaffolding protocols1 to generate, to our knowledge, the first reference-quality genomes of six bat species (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, Rousettus aegyptiacus, Phyllostomus discolor, Myotis myotis, Pipistrellus kuhlii and Molossus molossus). We integrated gene projections from our ‘Tool to infer Orthologs from Genome Alignments’ (TOGA) software with de novo and homology gene predictions as well as short- and long-read transcriptomics to generate highly complete gene annotations. To resolve the phylogenetic position of bats within Laurasiatheria, we applied several phylogenetic methods to comprehensive sets of orthologous protein-coding and noncoding regions of the genome, and identified a basal origin for bats within Scrotifera. Our genome-wide screens revealed positive selection on hearing-related genes in the ancestral branch of bats, which is indicative of laryngeal echolocation being an ancestral trait in this clade. We found selection and loss of immunity-related genes (including pro-inflammatory NF-κB regulators) and expansions of anti-viral APOBEC3 genes, which highlights molecular mechanisms that may contribute to the exceptional immunity of bats. Genomic integrations of diverse viruses provide a genomic record of historical tolerance to viral infection in bats. Finally, we found and experimentally validated bat-specific variation in microRNAs, which may regulate bat-specific gene-expression programs. Our reference-quality bat genomes provide the resources required to uncover and validate the genomic basis of adaptations of bats, and stimulate new avenues of research that are directly relevant to human health and disease1.","tags":["genomics","adaptation","evolutionary genetics","gene family evolution","immune response","transcriptomics"],"title":"Six reference-quality genomes reveal evolution of bat adaptations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kai Wang","Shilin Tian","Jorge Galindo-González","Liliana M.

New genome assemblies from two neotropical fruit bats (Artibeus jamaicensis and Sturnira hondurensis ) provide a framework for comparisons with Old World fruit bats. Comparative genomics of 10 bat species encompassing dietary diversity across the phylogeny revealed convergent molecular signatures of frugivory in both multigene family evolution and single‐copy genes. Evidence for convergent molecular adaptations associated with frugivorous diets includes the composition of three subfamilies of olfactory receptor genes, losses of three bitter taste receptor genes, losses of two digestive enzyme genes and convergent amino acid substitutions in several metabolic genes. By identifying suites of adaptations associated with the convergent evolution of frugivory, our analyses both reveal the extent of molecular mechanisms under selection in dietary shifts and will facilitate future studies of molecular ecology in mammals.","tags":["evolutionary genetics","positive selection","niche specialization","frugivory","chemosensation","gene family evolution","olfactory receptors","taste receptors","olfaction","genomics","metabolism"],"title":"Molecular adaptation and convergent evolution of frugivory in Old World and neotropical fruit bats","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Liliana M.

While new mutations are commonly considered engines of adaptive change, sensory evolution enabling access to new resources might also arise from standing genetic diversity, and even gene loss. We examine the relative contribution of molecular adaptations, measured by positive and relaxed selection, acting on eye-expressed genes associated with shifts to new adaptive zones in ecologically diverse bats from the superfamily Noctilionoidea. Collectively, noctilionoids display remarkable ecological breadth, from highly diver- gent echolocation to flight strategies linked to specialized insectivory, the parallel evolution of diverse plant-based diets (e.g., nectar, pollen and fruit) from ancestral insectivory, and—unusually for echolocating bats—often have large, well-developed eyes. We report contrasting levels of positive selection in genes associated with the development, maintenance and scope of visual function, tracing back to the origins of noctilionoids and Phyllostomidae (the bat family with most dietary diversity), instead of during shifts to novel diets. Generalized plant visiting was not associated with exceptional molecular adaptation, and exploration of these novel niches took place in an ancestral phyllostomid genetic background. In contrast, evidence for positive selection in vision genes was found at subsequent shifts to either nectarivory or frugivory. Thus, neotropical noctilionoids that use visual cues for identifying food and roosts, as well as for orientation, were effectively preadapted, with subsequent molecular adaptations in nectar-feeding lineages and the subfamily Stenodermatinae of fig-eating bats fine-tuning pre-existing visual adaptations for specialized purposes.","tags":["evolutionary genetics","positive selection","preadaptation","diversification","niche specialization","frugivory","vision","transcriptomics"],"title":"Foraging shifts and visual preadaptation in ecologically diverse bats","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anusha Shankar","Donald R Powers","Liliana M.

According to the metabolic level boundaries hypothesis, metabolic rates as a function of mass are expected to scale closer to 0.67 when driven by surface‐related processes (e.g., heat or water flux), while volume‐related processes (e.g., activity) generate slopes closer to one. In birds, daily energy expenditure (DEE) scales with body mass (M) in the relationship log (DEE) = 2.35 + 0.68 * log (M), consistent with surface‐level processes driving the relationship. However, taxon‐specific patterns differ from the scaling slope of all birds. Hummingbirds have the highest mass‐specific metabolic rates among all vertebrates. Previous studies on a few hummingbird species, without accounting for the phylogeny, estimated that the DEE‐body mass relationship for hummingbirds was log (DEE) = 1.72 + 1.21 * log (M). Contrary to theoretical expectations, this slope greater than 1 indicates that larger hummingbirds are less metabolically efficient than smaller hummingbirds. We collected DEE and mass data for 12 hummingbird species, which, combined with published data, represented 17 hummingbird species in eight of nine hummingbird clades over a six‐fold size range of body size (2.7 ‐ 17.5 g). After accounting for phylogenetic relatedness, we found daily energy expenditure scales with body mass as log (DEE) = 2.04 + 0.95 * log (M). This slope of 0.95 is lower than previously estimated for hummingbirds, but much higher than the slope for all birds (0.68). The high slopes of torpor, hovering and flight potentially explain the high interspecific DEE slope for hummingbirds compared to other endotherms.","tags":["allometry","adaptation","phylogenetic regression","hummingbirds","metabolism"],"title":"The allometry of daily energy expenditure in hummingbirds: an energy budget approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

To empirically test hypotheses about adaptive expansion and contraction of multigene families across species, models infer gene gain and loss in light of speciation events and these inferred gene family expansions may lead to interpretations of adaptations in particular lineages. While the relative abundance of a gene subfamily in the subgenome may reflect its functional importance, tests based on this expectation can be confounded by the complex relationship between the birth-death process of gene subfamily evolution and the species phylogeny. Using simulations, we confirmed tree heterogeneity as a confounding factor in inferring multi-gene adaptation, causing spurious associations between shifts in birth-death rate and lineages with higher branching rates. We then used the olfactory receptor (OR) repertoire, the largest gene family in the mammalian genome, of different bat species with divergent diets to test whether expansions in olfactory receptors are associated with shifts to frugivorous diets. After accounting for tree heterogeneity, we robustly inferred that certain OR subfamilies exhibited expansions associated with dietary shifts to frugivory. Taken together, these results suggest ecological correlates of individual OR gene subfamilies can be identified, setting the stage for detailed inquiry into within-subfamily functional differences.","tags":["genomics","Phyllostomidae","evolutionary genetics","gene family evolution","olfaction","olfactory receptors"],"title":"Species tree disequilibrium positively misleads models of gene family evolution","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dolors Armenteras","Pablo Negret","Luis F.

Molecular analyses of these gene families require high‐confidence sequences, but the high sequence similarity of the members can create challenges for sequencing and downstream analyses. Focusing on the common vampire bat, Desmodus rotundus, we evaluated how different sequencing approaches performed in recovering the largest mammalian protein‐coding multigene family: olfactory receptors (OR). Using the genome as a reference, we determined the proportion of putatively protein‐coding receptors recovered by: 1) amplicons from degenerate primers sequenced via Sanger technology, 2) RNA‐Seq of the main olfactory epithelium, and 3) those genes “captured” with probes designed from transcriptomes of closely‐related species. Our initial re‐annotation of the high‐quality vampire bat genome resulted in 400 intact OR genes, more than doubling the original estimate. Sanger‐sequenced amplicons performed the poorest among the three approaches, detecting 50% of the annotated genomic ORs, and targeted sequence capture recovered nearly 75% of annotated genes. Each sequencing approach assembled high‐quality sequences, even if it did not recover all receptors in the genome. While some variation may be due to limitations of the study design (e.g. different individuals), variation among approaches was mostly caused by low coverage of some receptors rather than high rates of assembly error. Given this variability, we caution against using the counts of intact receptors per species to model the birth‐death process of multigene families. Instead, our results support the use of orthologous sequences to explore and model the evolutionary processes shaping these genes.","tags":["genomics","bait capture","chemosensation","evolutionary genetics","gene family evolution","olfactory receptors","transcriptomics"],"title":"Evaluating the performance of targeted sequence capture, RNA-Seq, and degenerate-primer PCR cloning for sequencing the largest mammalian multigene family","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eleonora Dávalos","Liliana M.

We analyse the motivations of coca growers by estimating a discrete choice model including head of household characteristics, household variables, and agricultural unit attributes. We found that extremely poor farmers are more likely to grow coca than non-poor farmers in the same area, while households connected to the energy grid, with access to credit, and receiving cash payments for their licit crops, are less likely to grow coca crops. Our results suggest that strategies aiming to discourage farmers from growing coca should: 1) target specifically the poorest households in the region and not just seek to improve general living conditions, 2) expand rural electrification, and 3) enhance legal productivity by providing access to credit, technical support, and/or contracts on harvests before planting.","tags":["Andes","Colombia","coca","electrification","credit"],"title":"Social Investment and Smallholder Coca Cultivation in Colombia","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Laurel R.

From vomeronasal transcriptomes, we discovered the first evidence of intact vomeronasal type-1 receptor (V1r) genes in bats, and we tested whether putatively functional bat receptors were orthologous to those of related taxa, or whether bats have evolved novel receptors. Instead of lineage-specific duplications, we found that bat V1rs in bats show high levels of orthology to those of their relatives, and receptors are under comparative levels of purifying selection compared to non-bats. Despite widespread vomeronasal organ loss in bats, V1r copies have been retained for 65 million years. The highly conserved nature of bat V1rs challenges our current understanding of mammalian V1r function and suggest roles other than conspecific recognition or mating initiation in social behavior.","tags":["Laurasiatheria","transcriptomics","birth-death models","chemosensation","pseudogene","gene family evolution","evolutionary genetics","vomeronasal system","pheromone"],"title":"Expressed vomeronasal type-1 receptors (V1rs) in bats uncover conserved sequences underlying social chemical signaling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Brandon P.

Tightly integrated structures typically evolve in unison, whereas loosely integrated structures evolve separately. Highly integrated structures are therefore thought to constrain evolutionary change by limiting morphological disparity. Mounting evidence suggests that high integration may facilitate evolutionary change along a single trajectory. We used geometric morphometrics to compare cranial disparity and integration among phyllostomid bats—which exhibit the greatest dietary diversity of any mammalian family— and their sister taxa within the superfamily Noctilionoidea. Our results reveal that phyllostomids are more tightly integrated and have less disparity in cranial shape than their outgroups, despite exhibiting tenfold higher species richness and significantly increased rates of speciation. Phyllostomid cranial morphology appears to have diverged from that of other noctilionoids by evolving along a single axis of morphological variation that describes the relative length of the rostrum. We propose that phyllostomids were able to evolve to occupy a wide range of dietary niches by varying rostrum length, possibly along a line of least evolutionary resistance. This study provides a compelling empirical example of how increased integration can lead to adaptation, implying that both high and low integration can underlie diverse phenotypes in adaptive radiation.","tags":["Morphological evolution","3D morphometrics","Phyllostomidae","Noctilionoidea"],"title":"Morphological Diversification under High Integration in a Hyper Diverse Mammal Clade","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Organisms need strategies to survive when conditions are hard. For mammals, winter is particularly difficult - they have to invest large amounts of energy into keeping warm, while food availability is low. For this reason, many mammals migrate or hibernate. However, what to do if you are too small to migrate long distance, burn your energy fast, and cannot hibernate? The common shrew is such a mammal and has evolved an astonishing strategy: each individual shrinks in winter by up to 20% and then regrows in the spring by about 13%. This size change, thought to allow shrews to survive on fewer resources because of the smaller size and linked lower energy requirements, include not just overall size, but specifically organs that do not usually change size in fully grown animals, such as the brain, heart and liver. The process of neurological degeneration and regeneration is of great interest, since many central nervous system diseases (e.g., Alzheimer’s, multiple sclerosis) involve degeneration, but ongoing research for therapies to reverse this process has been of limited success. As one of only a few recorded examples of mammalian brain regeneration, understanding how the shrew regrows its brain can accelerate research that leads to future therapies. To answer the question of how the shrew shrinks and then regrows its brain, we will establish this unusual species as a new model, by studying the biological, molecular, biochemical and genetic processes behind this reversible size change. Besides establishing a database of information that can be mined and researched in years to come to discover the pathways that generate this cycle in the shrew, we will test a metabolic model of neurological change by artificially blocking molecular access to fats. Thus, the cross-disciplinary study of this wintering adaptation may help us understand more about regeneration in mammals in general, and the brain in particular.\n","date":1561939200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561939200,"objectID":"e7640586682153cfda69604818f94720","permalink":"https://lmdavalos.github.io/project/regrowing_the_brain/","publishdate":"2019-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/regrowing_the_brain/","section":"project","summary":"To answer the question of how the shrew shrinks and then regrows its brain, we will establish this unusual species as a new model, by studying the biological, molecular, biochemical and genetic processes behind this reversible size change.","tags":["genomics","transcriptomics","molecular evolution","current"],"title":"Regrowing the brain; evolution and mechanisms of seasonal reversible size changes in a mammal","type":"project"},{"authors":["Marisa C.W.

Consequently, repeated evolution of the same genetic mechanisms may occur across high-elevation taxa. To test this prediction, we investigated the extent to which the same biochemical pathways, genes, or sites were subject to parallel molecular evolution for 12 Andean hummingbird species (family: Trochilidae) representing several independent transitions to high elevation across the phylogeny. Across high-elevation species, we discovered parallel evolution for several pathways and genes with evidence of positive selection. In particular, positively selected genes were frequently part of cellular respiration, metabolism, or cell death pathways. To further examine the role of elevation in our analyses, we compared results for low- and high-elevation species and tested different thresholds for defining elevation categories. In analyses with different elevation thresholds, positively selected genes reflected similar functions and pathways, even though there were almost no specific genes in common. For example, EPAS1 (HIF2α), which has been implicated in high-elevation adaptation in other vertebrates, shows a signature of positive selection when high-elevation is defined broadly (1,500 m), but not when defined narrowly (2,500 m). Although a few biochemical pathways and genes change predictably as part of hummingbird adaptation to high-elevation conditions, independent lineages have rarely adapted via the same substitutions.","tags":["evolutionary genetics","transcriptomics","adaptation","dN/dS","phylogenetics","convergence","hummingbirds","Andes","metabolism"],"title":"Parallel molecular evolution in pathways, genes, and sites in high-elevation hummingbirds revealed by comparative transcriptomics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

Extremes are useful to understand both where current models break down and to build new ones. Coalescent models of population genetics are commonly used to estimate current and past genetic diversity, but they assume that the population in question is large and of a stable size. Species of conservation concern, in particular, are generally small and/or declining. Using simulations, I found that coalescent models mischaracterize the genetic diversity of recently-declined populations. Thus current estimates of genetic diversity and management decisions for endangered species that have been based on coalescent models could be dangerously misleading. By their nature, species with extreme adaptations often have small populations. Cyanide adaptation in bamboo specialized mammals is one such adaptation, because cyanide ingestion causes death by inhibition of cellular respiration. Thus the few cyanide adapted mammals, including bamboo lemurs and giant pandas, provide an opportunity to develop a model of genetic concerted convergence, the shared evolution of a suite of traits under similar selective pressures. To determine the biochemical adaptations to cyanide survival, I analyzed urine from wild bamboo lemurs, species that can survive up to 50 times the expected lethal dose of cyanide. Bamboo lemurs excrete higher concentrations of both cyanide and thiocyanate, the primary detoxification product, than recorded in any other mammal, suggesting dual adaptation in both cellular respiration and detoxification. This also implicates adaptations in thyroid function, because thiocyanate is a thyroid antagonist, and taste, because cyanide typically causes an aversive taste response. I identified genes under selection in these four pathways in bamboo lemurs and four other bamboo specialized clades and developed a statistical test to examine concerted convergence in cyanide adaptation. Three clades, including bamboo lemurs, evolved cyanide adaptations in this suite of four traits under a concerted convergence model. This is evidence of both the necessity of adapting to an ecological selection pressure across a common suite of traits, and that an extreme adaptation can be used to develop a new model for understanding the process of adaptation.","tags":["coalescence","evolutionary genetics","cyanide","lemurs","pandas"],"title":"In Extremis: Breaking Coalescent Models in Small Populations and Concerted Convergence of Mammalian Cyanide Adaptation","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1548460800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548460800,"objectID":"5d69843ec4a0f9f0def91f9d5be5421e","permalink":"https://lmdavalos.github.io/project/death_and_life_of_biodiversity/","publishdate":"2019-01-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/death_and_life_of_biodiversity/","section":"project","summary":"Data available for new students.

These two research approaches offer much promise to address not only many of the fundamental questions about life, but also many of the problems facing humanity, including the irreversible, ongoing, and rapid loss of biodiversity.\nConservation biologists have so far focused on risks of extinction, decline and collapse of species and ecosystems, while recognizing how just avoiding loss is not enough. Until recently, the ultimate goals of biodiversity conservation—recovery and restoration—have remained difficult, elusive, and vaguely defined. Earlier this year, a new framework for assessing species recovery and conservation success has been proposed. A central concept of this framework is the ecological functionality of populations, based on the idea that conserving species requires not only avoiding extinction, but also maintaining their contributions to ecosystem processes.\nThe practical application of this framework requires fundamental research about the relationships between ecological function and other organismal and genetic dimensions of biodiversity. We propose to develop a cross-scale research program that focuses on the relationships between phylogenetic diversity, genetic diversity and functional diversity of a biologically and economically important taxonomic group: bees.\nThe overall goal of the proposed research is to test hypotheses on the relationships among multiple dimensions of biological diversity, and their relevance for functioning of ecological communities. Our specific objectives for this OVPR Seed Proposal focus on preparing a strong initial proposal for NSF, potentially followed by additional proposals. We aim to\n Obtain preliminary genomic data via RNA transcripts and hybridization baits, Start developing a database of ecological functionality to relate species to their molecular and ecological function, Recruit collaborators to strengthen specific aspects of the planned proposal.  We have extensive experience in both the general subject area of the proposal, and the specific methodological and conceptual advances that underlie the proposed research program. However, we have never collaborated before, and we lack preliminary data on the system we propose to focus on. In order to build the collaboration and establish the preliminary data to successfully compete, we need the internal support provided by the OVPR seed funding. With funding from the OVPR Seed Grant Program, we plan to develop a new collaboration and a new research program that will likely lead to several externally funded projects over the coming 5-10 years. Our initial target will be the NSF program on Dimensions of Biodiversity ($2M total), but we expect that we will have multiple opportunities for external funding in the next year or so..\n","date":1548460800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548460800,"objectID":"607d4a17c409bc00f7da5ac6cb8faf64","permalink":"https://lmdavalos.github.io/project/very_extended_phenotype/","publishdate":"2019-01-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/very_extended_phenotype/","section":"project","summary":"We propose to develop a cross-scale research program that focuses on the relationships between phylogenetic diversity, genetic diversity and functional diversity of a biologically and economically important taxonomic group; bats.","tags":["expired"],"title":"The Very Extended Phenotype: connecting genetics and evolution to ecological function","type":"project"},{"authors":["Dolors Armenteras","Laura Schneider","Liliana M.

Mismatches between putatively functional DNA sequences, mRNA transcripts, and proteins implicate transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes in the ongoing loss of S-opsins in some noctilionoid bats.

Several studies suggest highland species are well adapted to these harsh conditions. Genetic adaptation is difficult to study in non-model organisms, especially as laboratory experiments are impractical for long-lived species. However, new genomic methods have revealed specific amino acid changes, genes, and biochemical pathways that are repeatedly involved in adaptation to survival in high altitude environments. My dissertation research addresses two questions: 1) What is the genetic basis for high-altitude adaptation in Andean hummingbirds? And 2) Are the mechanisms the same across divergent taxa and populations? I generated transcriptome data for 12 Andean hummingbird species occurring from low to high elevations that independently colonized the Peruvian Andes. Parallel molecular evolution can occur at any of several hierarchical levels of biological organization. I identified parallel evolution across highland species for several pathways, including those related to cellular respiration and cell death, but the genes and mutations often differed. I next examined these questions for populations of lowland and highland species in the Peruvian Andes. I conducted an exon capture sequencing experiment to map their spatial population genomic variation and to test for associations between genetic patterns and elevation while accounting for demographic history. I found that isolation by distance and physical barriers play principal roles in shaping spatial population genomic variation. In addition to population divergence, I also identified clinal variation in allele frequencies across elevation for SNPs in several genes with previous links to highland adaptation. Collectively, my results for Andean hummingbird species and populations indicate there is predictability in the genetic mechanisms of adaptation to high altitude, though there are a variety of adaptive paths. By investigating how organisms evolved to thrive in challenging environmental conditions, we can illuminate the mechanisms of evolution and refine future study of the units on which evolution acts.","tags":["Andean hummingbirds","hummingbirds","evolutionary genetics","diversification","Andes"],"title":"On the Evolution and Diversification of Andean Hummingbirds","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Laurel R.

Understanding when gene duplicates contribute new molecular functions to genomes through molecular adaptation is one important goal in comparative genomics. In large gene families, however, characterizing adaptation and neofunctionalization across species is challenging, as models have traditionally quantified the timing of duplications without considering underlying gene trees. This protocol combines multiple approaches to detect adaptation in protein duplicates at a phylogenetic scale. We include a description of models for gene tree-species tree reconciliation that enable different types of inference, as well as a practical guide to their use. Although simulation-based approaches successfully detect shifts in the rate of duplication/retention, the conflation between the duplication and retention processes, the distinct trajectories of duplicates under non-, sub-, and neofunctionalization, as well as dosage effects offer hitherto unexplored analytical avenues. We introduce mathematical descriptions of these probabilities and offer a road map to computational implementation whose starting point is parsimony reconciliation. Sequence evolution information based on the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous nucleotide substitution rates (dN/dS) can be combined with duplicate survival probabilities to better predict the emergence of new molecular functions in retained duplicates. Together, these methods enable characterization of potentially adaptive candidate duplicates whose neofunctionalization may contribute to phenotypic divergence across species.","tags":["Gene duplication","Gene tree","Birth-death models","Molecular evolution","dN/dS"],"title":"Protocols for the Molecular Evolutionary Analysis of Membrane Protein Gene Duplicates","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Liliana M.

Compared to traditional comparisons of PST to FST, the migration-based estimates of FST are unidirectional instead of bidirectional, simultaneously integrate variation among loci and individuals, and posterior densities of PST and FST can be compared directly. We found the evolution of higher call frequencies is inconsistent with genetic drift for the Hispaniolan population, despite many generations of isolation from its Puerto Rican counterpart. While the Hispaniolan population displays dimorphism in call frequencies, the higher frequency of the females is incompatible with sexual selection. Instead, cultural drift toward higher frequencies among Hispaniolan females might explain the divergence.

While both models are consistent with deforestation by campesino smallholders, only the frontier model predicts infrastructure investment increases forest loss. Contrary to the assumption of previous studies relating deforestation to coca, deforestation rates tend to be lower in areas with coca cultivation in Colombia and Peru, with the reverse tendency in Bolivia. Probabilistic models of deforestation controlling for a series of confounding variables confirmed no tendency of coca cultivation to increase or decrease deforestation rates in Colombia. Additionally, analyses examining the relationship between coca cultivation and migration to the Colombian frontier failed to find a consistent relationship, implying illicit crops are not the cause of migration. Instead, deforestation traces back to mid twentieth-century state-sponsored roads and colonization projects that promoted mass migration to the frontier.

However, these structures did not further shrink significantly over a 4-week staining interval, and 1 week in 2.5% iodine-based solution yielded sufficient contrast for differentiating among soft-tissues. Compared to six “fresh” bat specimens imaged shortly after field collection (not fixed in ethanol), the museum specimens had significantly lower relative volumes of the eyes and brains. Variation in field preparation techniques and conditions, and long-term storage in ethanol may be the primary causes of shrinkage in museum specimens rather than diceCT staining methodology. Identifying reliable tissue-specific correction factors to adjust for the shrinkage now documented in museum specimens requires future work with larger samples.","tags":["iodine-staining","microCT","bats","shrinkage","diceCT","Phyllostomidae"],"title":"Assessing Soft-Tissue Shrinkage Estimates in Museum Specimens Imaged With Diffusible Iodine-based Contrast-Enhanced Computed Tomography (diceCT)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eleonora Dávalos","Leonardo Fabio Morales","Jennifer S.

The mammalian vomeronasal system, a sense critical for mediating many social and reproductive behaviors, is highly conserved across mammals. New World Leaf-nosed bats (Phyllostomidae) are under strong selection to maintain a functional vomeronasal system such that most phyllostomids possess a distinct vomeronasal organ and an intact TRPC2, a gene encoding a protein primarily involved in vomeronasal sensory neuron signal transduction. Recent genetic evidence, however, shows that TRPC2 is a pseudogene in some Caribbean nectarivorous phyllostomids. The loss-of-function mutations suggest the sensory neural tissue of the vomeronasal organ is absent in these species despite strong selection on this gene in its mainland relatives, but the anatomy was unknown in most Caribbean nectarivorous phyllostomids until this study. We used diffusible iodine-based contrast-enhanced computed tomography (diceCT) to test whether the vomeronasal and main olfactory anatomy of several phyllostomid species matched genetic evidence of function, providing insight into whether loss of a structure is linked to pseudogenization of a molecular component of the system. The vomeronasal organ is indeed rudimentary or absent in species with a disrupted TRPC2 gene. Caribbean nectar-feeders also exhibit derived olfactory turbinal morphology and a large olfactory recess that differs from closely related bats that have an intact vomeronasal organ, which may hint that the main olfactory system may compensate for loss. We emphasize non-invasive diceCT is capable of detecting the vomeronasal organ, providing a feasible approach for quantifying mammalian chemosensory anatomy across species.","tags":["vestigial","vomeronasal organ","main olfactory system","chemosensation","diceCT","iodine-staining"],"title":"Vomeronasal and olfactory structures in bats revealed by diceCT clarify genetic evidence of function","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Laurel R.

The mammalian vomeronasal system, which detects social chemical cues important to fitness, is an impressive example of a sensory system lost multiple times.

We characterized the relationship between amino acid substitutions in a gene tightly linked to vomeronasal function (Trpc2) and the accessory olfactory bulb, a brain region that processes the detection of these vomeronasal chemical cues. By applying a phylogenetic logistic regression, we found a strong negative relationship between the branch lengths representing rates of codon changes in the Trpc2 gene tree and the presence or absence of an accessory olfactory bulb. Longer branch lengths predict loss of the accessory olfactory bulb, suggesting selection has relaxed on the system as a whole. Based on this relationship, we predicted the absence of an accessory olfactory bulb in 19 bat species with unknown morphology. Several species with predicted losses have specialized skull morphology, suggesting a potential tradeoff between adaptation in skull shape and maintenance of the vomeronasal system.

To uncover the consequences of overlooking this spatial component, we tested both spatially explicit and non‐spatial models of deforestation for Colombia.

Significant residual correlation showed that non‐spatial models failed to adequately explain the spatial structure of the data. Posterior predictive checks revealed that spatially explicit models had strong predictive power for the entire range of the response variable and only failed to predict outliers, in contrast with non‐spatial models, which lacked predictive power for all response values. The predictive power of non‐spatial models was especially low in regions away from Colombia's center, where about half the observations were clustered.

Mammals have a secondary chemosensory system known as vomerolfaction that is primarily attributed to detecting pheromones, chemical cues that mediate many social behaviors. Vomeronasal mechanisms are conserved across mammals because of vomerolfaction’s critical roles in reproduction and social communication. Such mechanisms include the pheromone detection by vomeronasal receptors (e.g. V1Rs) and signal transduction of the Transient receptor potential cation channel 2 (Trpc2), an ion channel indispensable for vomeronasal function. Despite a nocturnal lifestyle and gregarious behaviors, most bats surprisingly lack a functioning vomeronasal system, exhibiting degraded vomeronasal morphology and pseudogenized Trpc2 and V1Rs. New World Leaf-nosed bats (Phyllostomidae) are one of the few exceptions where the vomeronasal system is well maintained. It is unclear whether phyllostomids have retained vomeronasal function through time while other bats have independently lost function or if they have regained the functional sensory system, potentially serving as a key innovation related to their diversity. To address this question, I sequenced the V1R profiles from the vomeronasal transcriptome from a diversity of phyllostomids and sequenced Trpc2 exon 2 in over 100 bats across nearly every family.  Compiling the V1R data with existing mammal species, the phylogenetic history of the gene tree suggested phyllostomids V1Rs are completely orthologous with the dog and horse, providing no evidence that phyllostomids have evolved a new set of vomeronasal receptors. Additionally, many non-phyllostomids showed independent pseudogenizing mutations of Trpc2 while phyllostomids showed a signature of strong purifying selection to maintain a functional Trpc2. I simulated sequences under similar selection constraints to determine if it Trpc2 was under relaxed selection early within the phylogeny or if purifying selection has been prevalent throughout the evolutionary history of phyllostomid bats. My results showed it was unlikely that Trpc2 reactivated and supports the notion that phyllostomids have maintained vomeronasal function since the divergence with other laurasiatherians. My results also emphasize that the chemosensory system is a crucial aspect of sensory biology for some bats, a modality often underappreciated in light of other extreme bat senses.","tags":["Bats","Chemosensation","Molecular evolution","Pheromone","Phylogenetics","Vomeronasal system"],"title":"The Molecular Evolution of Bat Chemosensory Pathways Reveals Sensory Innovation and Loss","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dolors Armenteras","Cerian Gibbes","Jesús A.

The United Nations program on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) aims to sustainably manage forests, as well as to conserve and enhance their carbon stocks. Despite the crucial role of fire management, decision‐making on REDD+ interventions fails to systematically include fires. Here, we address this critical knowledge gap in two ways. First, we review REDD+ projects and programs to assess the inclusion of fires in monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) systems. Second, we model the relationship between fire and forest for a pilot site in Colombia using near‐real‐time (NRT) fire monitoring data derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The literature review revealed fire remains to be incorporated as a key component of MRV systems. Spatially explicit modeling of land use change showed the probability of deforestation declined sharply with increasing distance to the nearest fire the preceding year (multi‐year model area under the curve [AUC] 0.82). Deforestation predictions based on the model performed better than the official REDD early‐warning system. The model AUC for 2013 and 2014 was 0.81, compared to 0.52 for the early‐warning system in 2013 and 0.68 in 2014. This demonstrates NRT fire monitoring is a powerful tool to predict sites of forest deforestation. Applying new, publicly available, and open‐access NRT fire data should be an essential element of early‐warning systems to detect and prevent deforestation.

In this study, we use the Transient receptor potential cation channel 2 (Trpc2) as a molecular marker for testing the evolutionary mechanisms of loss and gain of the mammalian vomeronasal system. We sequenced Trpc2 exon 2 in over 100 bat species across 17 of 20 chiropteran families.

Here, we reconstruct the diversity trajectory in noctilionoid bats of the Greater Antilles by applying a dynamic model of colonization, extinction and speciation to phylogenetic and palaeontological data including all known extinct and extant species. We show species richness asymptotes to an equilibrium value, a demonstration of natural equilibrium dynamics across an entire community. However, recent extinctions—many caused by humans—have wiped out nearly a third of island lineages, dragging diversity away from equilibrium. Using a metric to measure island biodiversity loss, we estimate it will take at least eight million years to regain pre-human diversity levels.

As cultivation continues despite eradication, a shift to giving farmers more incentives to abandon coca is currently proposed. Assuming coca cultivation is an important cause of migration and deforestation, new alternative development projects also aim to conserve forests. We show coca cultivation strongly increases near never-completed 1960s–1970s state-sponsored projects to settle the Amazon. Improved roads and colonization projects opened the western Amazon frontier to migration, generating deforestation and, once support dwindled, setting the stage for coca cultivation. New studies also show coca cultivation generates negligible direct or indirect forest loss and fails to explain migration, whereas expanding legal agriculture, roads, displacement, and eradication increase deforestation. These findings highlight the urgent need to both commit development investment for the long term and set explicit conservation goals in western Amazonia.","tags":["Amazon","Amazon-Andes","alternative development","conservation","illegal drugs","illicit crops","Marginal de la Selva","hierarchical models","mixed models","Bayesian"],"title":"Deforestation and Coca Cultivation Rooted in Twentieth-Century Development Projects","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1473379200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1473379200,"objectID":"9e09466375c62d3b6fb2ebbe0f5d076c","permalink":"https://lmdavalos.github.io/project/spatial_data_analysis/","publishdate":"2016-09-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/spatial_data_analysis/","section":"project","summary":"This training program responds to the challenges of new careers at the interface between science and decision making with an interdisciplinary set of new courses and a suite of activities united by the theme of \"Scientific Training and Research to Inform DEcisions\" (STRIDE).","tags":["spatial analysis","tropical biology","current"],"title":"Interdisciplinary Graduate Training to Understand and Inform Decision Processes Using Advanced Spatial Data Analysis and Visualization","type":"project"},{"authors":["Coen Bussink","Chloé Carpentier","Liliana M.

Moreover, illicit crop cultivation frequently takes place in biodiversity hotspots hosting a large number of species with a limited habitat, some of which are protected areas. It tends to occur close to the agricultural frontier, which demarcates the border between pristine forest and developed areas, and can result in the clearing of forests. Although empirical evidence and rigorous analy- sis do not support the claim that illicit cultivation is the major driver of deforestation, research does suggest that a lack of rural development drives the phenomenon. Analy- sis has shown, moreover, that drug trafficking can have a direct impact on deforestation through the construction of infrastructure such as landing strips and illegal roads, as well as indirectly through the privatization of public land to create “narco-estates”. When eradication induces a displacement of the location of drug crops it may result in deforestation as farmers react to eradication initiatives and seek places out of the reach of law enforcement. The disposal of chemicals used in the illicit manufacture of cocaine and opiates can also have negative consequences on the environment, contributing to pollution and health hazards in rural communities. In the case of synthetic drugs, the consequences in urban settings not only pose health risks but may also have an impact on the urban and industrial environment.","tags":["Marginal de la Selva","illicit crops","Colombia","Peru","Bolivia","Amazon-Andes","United Nations","Amazon"],"title":"The world drug problem and sustainable development","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Miguel S.

We used two models to infer the phylogeny and divergence times for living and fossil primates, the tip-dating (TD) and fossilized birth–death process (FBD). We collected new morphological data, especially on the living and extinct endemic lemurs of Madagascar. We combined the morphological data with published DNA sequences to infer near-complete (88% of lemurs) time-calibrated phylogenies.

We infer novel relationships among extinct lemurs, and strong support for relationships that were previously unresolved. Dates inferred with TD were significantly older than those inferred with FBD, most likely related to an assumption of a uniform branching process in the TD compared with a birth–death process assumed in the FBD.

Here we assess the influence of these factors on the timing of speciation with new multilocus data for New World noctilionoid bats (Chiroptera Noctilionoidea). Biogeographic analyses revealed the importance of the Neotropics in noctilionoid diversification, and the critical role of dispersal. We detected no shift in speciation rate associated with the Quaternary or pre-Quaternary periods, and instead found an increase in speciation linked to the evolution of the subfamily Stenodermatinae (∼18 Ma). Simulations modeling constant speciation and extinction rates for the phylogeny systematically showed more speciation events in the Quaternary. Since recording more divergence events in the Quaternary can result from lineage accumulation, the age of extant sister species cannot be interpreted as supporting higher speciation rates during this period. Instead, analyzing the factors that influence speciation requires modeling lineage-specific traits and environmental, spatial, and ecological drivers of speciation.","tags":["fossils","geographic range evolution","Neotropics","Phyllostomidae","speciation","Noctilionoidea","phylogenetics","phylogeny","diversification","Bayesian phylogenetics"],"title":"Bats (Chiroptera: Noctilionoidea) Challenge a Recent Origin of Extant Neotropical Diversity","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Laurel R.

Here, we examine the conversion of forests to pastures and coca crops (illicit activity) on the San Lucas Mountain Range, Colombia for 2002–2007 and 2007–2010. Land use maps and biophysical variables were used as inputs to generate land use and cover change (LUCC) models using the DINAMICA EGO software. These analyses revealed a dramatic acceleration of the pace of deforestation in the region, with rates of conversion from forest to pasture doubling from the first to the second period. Altitude, distance to other crops, and distance to rivers were the primary drivers of deforestation. The influence of these drivers, however, differed markedly depending on whether coca cultivation or pastures replaced forest. Conversion to coca was more probable farther from other crops and from settlements. In contrast, proximity to other crops and to settlements increased conversion to pasture. These relationships highlight the different roles of coca and pastures in forest loss, with coca tending to open up new forest frontiers, and pastures tending to consolidate agricultural expansion and urban influence. Large differences between LUCC processes for each period suggest highly dynamic changes, likely associated with shifting underlying causes of deforestation. These changes may relate to shifts in demand for illicit crops, land, or mining products; however, the data to test these hypotheses are currently lacking. More frequent and detailed monitoring is required to guide actions to decrease the loss of forest in this highly vulnerable biodiversity hotspot in the Northern Andes.","tags":["Andean forest","deforestation","Andes","San Lucas","direct factors","underlying factors","illicit crops","Bayesian"],"title":"A Bayesian Spatial Model Highlights Distinct Dynamics in Deforestation from Coca and Pastures in an Andean Biodiversity Hotspot","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Romain A.

This obligate dependency has been proposed to explain why multiple amino acid transporter genes are maintained in the genomes of the insect hosts. We implemented phylogenetic comparative methods to test whether amino acid transporters have proliferated in sternorrhynchan genomes at rates grater than expected by chance. By applying a series of methods to reconcile gene and species trees, inferring the size of gene families in ancestral lineages, and simulating the null process of birth and death in multi-gene families, we uncovered a 10-fold increase in duplication rate in the AAAP family of amino acid transporters within Sternorrhyncha. This gene family expansion was unmatched in other closely related clades lacking endosymbionts that provide essential amino acids. Our findings support the influence of obligate endosymbioses on host genome evolution by both inferring significant expansions of gene families involved in symbiotic interactions, and discovering increases in the rate of duplication associated with multiple emergences of obligate symbiosis in Sternorrhyncha.

Two groups that deviate markedly from this pattern are bats and African mole-rats, with members of both groups being extremely long-lived given their body size, with the maximum documented lifespan for many species exceeding 20 years. A recent genomics study of the exceptionally long-lived Brandt's bat, Myotis brandtii (41 years), suggested that its longevity and small body size may be at least partly attributed to key amino acid substitutions in the transmembrane domains of the receptors of growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1). However, whereas elevated longevity is likely to be common across all 19 bat families, the reported amino acid substitutions were only observed in two closely related bat families. To test the hypothesis that an altered GH/IGF1 axis relates to the longevity of African mole-rats and bats, we compared and analysed the homologous coding gene sequences in genomic and transcriptomic data from 26 bat species, five mole-rats and 38 outgroup species. Phylogenetic analyses of both genes recovered the majority of nodes in the currently accepted species tree with high support. Compared to other clades, such as primates and carnivores, the bats and rodents had longer branch lengths. The single 24 amino acid transmembrane domain of IGF1R was found to be more conserved across mammals compared to that of GHR. Within bats, considerable variation in the transmembrane domain of GHR was found, including a previously unreported deletion in Emballonuridae. The transmembrane domains of rodents were found to be more conserved, with mole-rats lacking uniquely conserved amino acid substitutions. Molecular evolutionary analyses showed that both genes were under purifying selection in bats and mole-rats. Our findings suggest that while the previously documented mutations may confer some additional lifespan to Myotis bats, other, as yet unknown, genetic differences are likely to account for the long lifespans observed in many bat and mole-rat species.","tags":["mammal","bats","mole-rats","longevity","transmembrane domains","dN/dS","evolutionary genetics","adaptation"],"title":"Molecular evolution of growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptors in long-lived, small-bodied mammals","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1409011200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1409011200,"objectID":"3ee0f3c0b8761e969a43a9782009f3e4","permalink":"https://lmdavalos.github.io/project/discovering_genomic_and_developmental_mechanisms/","publishdate":"2014-08-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/discovering_genomic_and_developmental_mechanisms/","section":"project","summary":"Data available to new students.

The combination of distance- and topology-based criteria will incur false-positive error rates well above 5% when ancestral effective population sizes are large and when population structure has been in place for 10,000 years or more. This effect persists even with a subtle bias in dispersal of 1 : 4 female : males dispersing in each generation. High false-positive error rates in genetic distances can be overcome by correcting for within-population sequence divergence.

If characters are independent and free of systematic errors, then combining as many different kinds of characters as are available will result in the best-supported phylogenetic hypotheses. But since morphological characters are subject to natural selection for function and arise from the expression of developmental pathways, they may not be independent, a situation that may amplify any underlying homoplasy. Here, we use new dental and multi-locus genetic data from bats (Mammalia: Chiroptera) to quantify saturation and similarity in morphological characters and introduce two likelihood-based approaches to identify strongly conflicting characters and integrate morphological and molecular data. We implement these methods to analyze the phylogeny of incomplete Miocene fossils in the radiation of Phyllostomidae (New World Leaf-nosed Bats), perhaps the most ecologically diverse family of living mammals. Morphological characters produced trees incongruent with molecular phylogenies, were saturated, and showed rates of change higher than most molecular substitution rates. Dental characters encoded variation similar to that in other morphological characters, while molecular characters encoded highly dissimilar variation in comparison. Saturation and high rates of change indicate randomization of phylogenetic signal in the morphological data, and extensive similarity suggests characters are non-independent and errors are amplified. To integrate the morphological data into tree building while accounting for homoplasy, we used statistical molecular scaffolds and combined phylogenetic analyses excluding a small subset of strongly conflicting dental characters. The phylogenies revealed the Miocene nectar-feeding †Palynephyllum nests within the crown nectar-feeding South American subfamily Lonchophyllinae, while the Miocene genus †Notonycteris is sister to the extant carnivorous Vampyrum.

Intriguing patterns of host genome evolution, including remarkable numbers of gene duplications, have been observed in the pea aphid, a sap‐feeding insect that relies on a bacterial endosymbiont for amino acid provisioning. Previously, we proposed that gene duplication has been important for the evolution of symbiosis based on aphid‐specific gene duplication in amino acid transporters (AATs), with some paralogs highly expressed in the cells housing symbionts (bacteriocytes). Here, we use a comparative approach to test the role of gene duplication in enabling recruitment of AATs to bacteriocytes. Using genomic and transcriptomic data, we annotate AATs from sap‐feeding and non sap‐feeding insects and find that, like aphids, AAT gene families have undergone independent large‐scale gene duplications in three of four additional sap‐feeding insects. RNA‐seq differential expression data indicate that, like aphids, the sap‐feeding citrus mealybug possesses several lineage‐specific bacteriocyte‐enriched paralogs. Further, differential expression data combined with quantitative PCR support independent evolution of bacteriocyte enrichment in sap‐feeding insect AATs. Although these data indicate that gene duplication is not necessary to initiate host/symbiont amino acid exchange, they support a role for gene duplication in enabling AATs to mediate novel host/symbiont interactions broadly in the sap‐feeding suborder Sternorrhyncha. In combination with recent studies on other symbiotic systems, gene duplication is emerging as a general pattern in host genome evolution.","tags":["aphid","bacteriocyte","functional evolution","gene duplication","mealybug","sap-feeding insect","phylogeny","Bayesian phylogenetics"],"title":"Dynamic recruitment of amino acid transporters to the insect/symbiont interface","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Liliana M.

Two dominant hypotheses explain this process. First, according to the hamburger connection beef markets promote conversion of forests into cattle ranches resulting in deforestation. Second, the land-as-wealth hypothesis explains deforestation as the result of land appreciation in forest frontiers. We tested these hypotheses using land use and socioeconomic data from northwestern Amazonia from 2000 to 2009. We also investigated two key control variables: coca cultivation and eradication, both of which have been proposed as important drivers of forest loss. We found high rate of conversion from forest to pasture, and unimpeded forest fragmentation. As predicted by the hamburger connection, pastures expanded as the cattle inventory grew. Beef demand did not drive pasture expansion, as ranching revenues declined and beef prices were roughly stable. Coca cultivation did not respond to the eradication campaign, and declined as the population became increasingly urbanized. We propose that investment on roads has enhanced the anticipated value of land.

We elucidated whether the evolution of the OR gene repertoire can be linked to ecological niche specializations, such as sensory modalities and diet. The OR gene repertoires of 27 bat species spanning the chiropteran radiation were amplified and sequenced. For each species, intact and nonfunctional genes were assessed, and the OR gene abundances in each gene family were analyzed and compared. We identified a unique OR pattern linked to the frugivorous diet of New World fruit-eating bats and a similar convergent pattern in the Old World fruit-eating bats.

These hypotheses, however, have not been tested against a null model of climate‐driven postglacial area loss. Here, we use a new Quaternary mammal database and deep‐sea bathymetry to estimate species–area relationships (SARs) at present and during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) for bats of the Caribbean, and to model species loss as a function of area loss from rising sea level. Island area was a significant predictor of species richness in the Bahamas, Greater Antilles, and Lesser Antilles at all time periods, except for the Lesser Antilles during the LGM. Parameters of LGM and current SARs were similar in the Bahamas and Greater Antilles, but not the Lesser Antilles, which had fewer estimated species during the LGM than expected given their size. Estimated postglacial species losses in the Bahamas and Greater Antilles were largely explained by inferred area loss from rising sea level in the Holocene. However, there were more species in the Bahamas at present, and fewer species in the smaller Greater Antilles, than expected given island size and the end‐Pleistocene/early Holocene SARs. Poor fossil sampling and ecological factors may explain these departures from the null. Our analyses illustrate the importance of changes in area in explaining patterns of species richness through time and emphasize the role of the SAR as a null hypothesis in explorations of the impact of novel ecological interactions on extinction.","tags":["climate change","deglaciation","glaciation","sea-level rise","species-area relationship","extinction","island biogeography","fossils"],"title":"Deglaciation explains bat extinction in the Caribbean","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Liliana M.

However, differential rates of change and the evolutionary mechanisms driving those rates result in pervasive phylogenetic conflict. These drivers need to be uncovered because mismatches between evolutionary processes and phylogenetic models can lead to high confidence in incorrect hypotheses. Incongruence between phylogenies derived from morphological versus molecular analyses, and between trees based on different subsets of molecular sequences has become pervasive as datasets have expanded rapidly in both characters and species. For more than a decade, evolutionary relationships among members of the New World bat family Phyllostomidae inferred from morphological and molecular data have been in conflict. Here, we develop and apply methods to minimize systematic biases, uncover the biological mechanisms underlying phylogenetic conflict, and outline data requirements for future phylogenomic and morphological data collection. We introduce new morphological data for phyllostomids and outgroups and expand previous molecular analyses to eliminate methodological sources of phylogenetic conflict such as taxonomic sampling, sparse character sampling, or use of different algorithms to estimate the phylogeny. We also evaluate the impact of biological sources of conflict: saturation in morphological changes and molecular substitutions, and other processes that result in incongruent trees, including convergent morphological and molecular evolution. Methodological sources of incongruence play some role in generating phylogenetic conflict, and are relatively easy to eliminate by matching taxa, collecting more characters, and applying the same algorithms to optimize phylogeny. The evolutionary patterns uncovered are consistent with multiple biological sources of conflict, including saturation in morphological and molecular changes, adaptive morphological convergence among nectar‐feeding lineages, and incongruent gene trees. Applying methods to account for nucleotide sequence saturation reduces, but does not completely eliminate, phylogenetic conflict. We ruled out paralogy, lateral gene transfer, and poor taxon sampling and outgroup choices among the processes leading to incongruent gene trees in phyllostomid bats. Uncovering and countering the possible effects of introgression and lineage sorting of ancestral polymorphism on gene trees will require great leaps in genomic and allelic sequencing in this species‐rich mammalian family. We also found evidence for adaptive molecular evolution leading to convergence in mitochondrial proteins among nectar‐feeding lineages. In conclusion, the biological processes that generate phylogenetic conflict are ubiquitous, and overcoming incongruence requires better models and more data than have been collected even in well‐studied organisms such as phyllostomid bats.","tags":["convergence","incongruence","gene trees","partitioned likelihood support","phylogenetics","phylogeny","Phyllostomidae","saturation","species trees","systematic error","Bayesian phylogenetics"],"title":"Understanding phylogenetic incongruence: lessons from phyllostomid bats","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Angelique P.

We also present the i rst complete list of all its extant and extinct mammals. The mammalian biota is older than was earlier presumed, with many ancient endemic lineages, even among highly vagile organisms such as bats. Land bridges, Cenozoic eustatic sea-level changes, and Pleistocene glacial cycles have been proposed to explain the colonization of the islands, but phylogenetic divergence analyses often conflict with the timing of these events and favor alternative biogeographic histories. The loss of West Indian biodiversity is incompletely understood, but new radiometric chronologies indicate that anthropogenic impacts rather than glacial-interglacial environmental changes are responsible for most Quaternary extinction and extirpation events involving land mammals. However, many outstanding questions of historical biogeography remain unresolved, including appropriate methods for interpreting phylogenies and divergence estimates in a biogeographic context, and whether to use vicariance or dispersal as the null hypothesis when investigating regional patterns of colonization, speciation, and extinction in comparative analyses.

However, there are few empirical examples of how ecological opportunity and morphological innovation open new adaptive zones, and promote diversification. We analyse data on diet, skull morphology and bite performance, and relate these traits to diversification rates throughout the evolutionary history of an ecologically diverse family of mammals (Chiroptera: Phyllostomidae). We found a significant increase in diversification rate driven by increased speciation at the most recent common ancestor of the predominantly frugivorous subfamily Stenodermatinae. The evolution of diet was associated with skull morphology, and morphology was tightly coupled with biting performance, linking phenotype to new niches through performance. Following the increase in speciation rate, the rate of morphological evolution slowed, while the rate of evolution in diet increased. This pattern suggests that morphology stabilized, and niches within the new adaptive zone of frugivory were filled rapidly, after the evolution of a new cranial phenotype that resulted in a certain level of mechanical efficiency. The tree-wide speciation rate increased non linearly with a more frugivorous diet, and was highest at measures of skull morphology associated with morphological extremes, including the most derived Stenodermatines. These results show that a novel stenodermatine skull phenotype played a central role in the evolution of frugivory and increasing speciation within phyllostomids.","tags":["diversification","morphological innovation","bats","frugivory","Phyllostomidae","Stenodermatinae","trophic level","phylogenetic regression","phylogeny","Bayesian phylogenetics"],"title":"Morphological innovation, diversification and invasion of a new adaptive zone","type":"publication"},{"authors":["R.

The methods of refuge biogeography helped shape early conservation priorities in Amazonia, although actual plans did not directly depend on the conceptual strengths or weaknesses of refugia biogeography. These approaches viewed people mostly as threats, though not always explicitly. Based on his work on primate distribution, Márcio Ayres formulated a synthetic speciation theory, the river-refuge hypothesis. The river-refuge model successfully resolved some of the historical and technical challenges of the earlier hypotheses. His work in várzea conservation, informed by this conceptual breakthrough, recognized that the maintenance of processes is at least as important as species numbers in prioritizing action.

Methods New mitochondrial cytochrome b and nuclear Rag2 sequences were combined with published molecular data to estimate phylogenetic relationships and sequence divergence among Short‐faced bats. The resulting phylogenies were compared with those compatible with the single‐origin hypothesis using two model‐based statistical tests. Confidence limits on sequence divergence were estimated using a parametric bootstrap. Results All molecular phylogenies revealed two independent Caribbean lineages and showed that continental Short‐faced bats share a recent common ancestor. Morphology‐based trees compatible with the single‐origin hypothesis were significantly worse at explaining the molecular data than any molecular phylogeny. Main conclusions The ancestor of all Short‐faced bats reached the Antilles in the Miocene, too recently to have used a proposed Oligocene land bridge, and well before the Pleistocene glaciations that are thought to have facilitated dispersal for many bats. After a long period of isolation, Short‐faced bats diversified quickly on the Caribbean islands. A single Short‐faced lineage then reached the continent and subsequently expanded its range and diversified into the four extant genera. Among bats, independent lineages of aerial insectivores and nectarivores have also recolonized the continent after evolving in the West Indies.

The ecosystem function of these natural habitats benefits millions of Colombians who depend on their water, wood, bushmeat, and medicinal plants (Rodríguez \u0026 Ponce, 1999). Over several centuries, the advance of the agricultural frontier has fragmented these ecosystems resulting in the extirpation of endemic species, natural disasters, and a general decline in environmental quality, particularly in the Andes and the Caribbean region (Cavelier \u0026 Etter, 1995; Cavelier et al., 1998; Etter \u0026 van Wyngarden, 2000). Over the last decade, however, incentives for agricultural production in Colombia have decreased. The output of annual crops fell at an average annual rate of 3.2%, agricultural production lost 4% of its relative importance in the GDP, and agricultural imports have increased almost 10-fold (Jaramillo, 2001; Robledo, 1999; Vásquez, 1997). Nonetheless, the fragmentation of natural ecosystems persists partly because of the expansion of other legal economic activities—perennial crops, cattle ranching, mining, and timber exploitation—as well as that of illicit crops whose exponential growth has paralleled the escalation of armed conflict (Álvarez, 2001, 2003).","tags":["environmental damage","crime prevention","armed group","Andean forest","deforestation"],"title":"Environmental damage from illicit drug crops in Colombia","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Liliana M.

Research on the origin and diversification of island biotas is particularly appealing because these have inspired classical models in biogeography. This study examined competing explanations of Caribbean historical biogeography: an Oligocene land bridge between northern South America and the West Indies, and Cenozoic dispersal from South America and/or Central America. Separate and combined phylogenetic analyses were conducted using new molecular data and published morphological characters for five monophyletic bat lineages; Mormoops, Pteronotus, a clade comprising Brachyphylla, Erophylla, and Phyllonycteris, the subtribe Stenodermatina, and Natalidae. The resulting phylogenies were analyzed using event-based biogeographic methods, synthesized into hypotheses of area relationships, and used to generate estimates of divergence times at critical nodes. The phylogenies of three of the five lineages are congruent with a single range expansion onto the Caribbean, whereas Mormoops is also consistent with this result but further studies of fossil remains are necessary, and Antillean Pteronotus appears to be a product of at least two separate invasions. Continental Stenodermatina and Natalidae descended from Caribbean ancestors. The ancestral areas of all the lineages are Mexico, Central America, and northern South America. The patterns of area relationships derived from phylogenies are equivocal in their support for the land bridge hypothesis. The ages of the bat lineages appear to be too young to have used an Oligocene land bridge. Instead, lowering and rising sea levels at key transitions during the Miocene may have facilitated the spread, and subsequent isolation, of the bat lineages leading to diversification and shared biogeographic pattern. The role of the Miocene in Caribbean biogeographic history should be tested with additional phylogenies, new molecular data, as well as the fossil record. The correlation of geological history, phylogenetic patterns, and the timing of diversification in bats demonstrates congruent biogeographic patterns in the Caribbean are pervasive even among the most vagile organisms.","tags":["extinction","Caribbean","West Indies","Antilles","dispersal","vicariance","Bayesian phylogenetics","phylogenetics"],"title":"Historical biogeography of the Antilles: Earth history and phylogenetics of endemic chiropteran taxa","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Liliana M.

Sloths, rodents and primates also roughly fit the timing of arrival to the Caribbean implied by Gaarlandia. The remaining taxa show contradictory dates of divergence according to molecular clock estimates, and no taxa fit the predicted timing and pattern of divergence among Antillean landmasses under the Gaarlandia model.

We highlight the difficulties in developing and implementing these policies, arising from the conflicting goals of regulating and facilitating AGR, as well as the special character of genetic resources, existing ex situ collections, issues of ownership and tenure, and the dearth of legal, institutional, and scientific capacity in many countries. We recommend (1) independent, multidisciplinary evaluation of the success of the access policy in achieving CBD objectives, (2) resolution of the conflict between traditional land tenure and legal property rights of genetic resources so as to match conservation obligations with benefit-sharing rights, (3) recognition that benefits obtained from AGR may be entirely non-monetary, and (4) that countries provide a 'two-track’ AGR application process separately for commercial and non-commercial users.","tags":["Andean Pact","Biodiversity","Bioprospecting","Brazil","Colombia","Convention on Biological Diversity","Genetic resources","International environmental law","Legislation","Philippines"],"title":"Regulating access to genetic resources under the Convention on Biological Diversity: an analysis of selected case studies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Maria D.

I conducted a geographic analysis of the distribution of illicit crops relative to standing forests and areas of conservation priority for birds. Municipalities where illicit crops have been detected were overlaid on a forest‐cover map of Colombia and two types of conservation priorities for birds were plotted: distributions of threatened species and minimum‐area sets for conservation of all species. The sites of the highest conservation priority affected by illicit crops were in the southern Andes, the northern West Andes and adjacent Darién lowlands, the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, Serranía del Perijá, and the Serranía de San Lucas. The largest forested areas threatened by illicit crops were in Amazonia and the Amazonian foothills of the East Andes, sites of low conservation priority. Given current trends in the expansion of illicit crops and the narrow endemicity of some bird species, the conversion of forests for illicit‐crop cultivation may result in the extirpation of several bird species from affected regions. To impede this, those involved in illicit‐crop eradication and alternative development should give high priority to the protection of existing forest reserves and parks from the planting of illicit crops. Such efforts should also extend to areas proposed for conservation based on the diversity of threatened and endemic birds that are currently unprotected. The conservation of threatened and endemic birds in Colombian forests may hinge on successfully curbing incentives for deforestation, including the international trade in illicit drugs.","tags":["protected areas","aves","illicit crops","Amazon","Andes"],"title":"Illicit Crops and Bird Conservation Priorities in Colombia","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1022889600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1022889600,"objectID":"918cc0fbabf95321c076e1eb6ca3e252","permalink":"https://lmdavalos.github.io/project/historical_biogeography_antilles/","publishdate":"2002-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/historical_biogeography_antilles/","section":"project","summary":"The project will generate hypotheses about the evolutionary relationships of 5 different groups of bats, each containing at least one exclusively Antillean species.

The few cases of direct intervention by multinational corporations at international fora suggest their interests are expressed elsewhere. The authors identify and discuss three types of intervention in the existing forest regime: avoidance, enforcement-driven compliance, and performance-driven compliance. The regime has not achieved performance-driven compliance from multinational corporations because the regime itself is weak and has little support from states internationally and domestically. The authors suggest that multinational corporations have been so effective at avoiding or conditioning compliance that incentives for complying fully with the regime are nil.","tags":["deforestation","United Nations","multinational corporations"],"title":"Missing the Forest for the Profits: The Role of Multinational Corporations in the International Forest Regime","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Liliana M.

Through its socioeconomic effects violent conflict can result in threats pertinent to both conservation and resource management schemes. A survey of the San Lucas mountain range, at the northern tip of the Colombian Central Andes, is presented as a case study of factors associated with violent conflict that may hinder or enhance conservation in this complex social and political setting. Instability in land use and tenure associated with armed conflict were identified as major pressures associated with further conversion of tropical forest habitats; while low rates of settlement and measures enforced by armed rule were very effective in preserving certain tracts of forest. War certainly alleviates demographic pressure from settlers, but contemporary patterns of colonization in San Lucas suggest that armed conflict is detrimental to conservation purposes and to key members of the biological community.","tags":["Colombia","deforestation","armed conflict","war","gold mining","Andes","San Lucas"],"title":"The San Lucas mountain range in Colombia how much conservation is owed to the violence?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Liliana M.

La segregación de 74 marcadores RFLP provenientes del mapa molecular de arroz (McCouch et al, 1988; McCouch, 1990; Causse et al., 1994 y Nagamura et al., 1993) en estas líneas, se utilizó para generar un mapa genético del cruce con el objetivo de ubicar en el mapa y rastrear la procedencia de los genes de resistencia a la hoja blanca presentes en la progenie. La mayoría -67%- de las líneas evaluadas fue resistente al virus, incluyendo una fracción -20%- más resistente que el testigo, Colombia 1. La distribución de la variación en la resistencia de la progenie fue continua. Se encontraron dos regiones, una en el cromosoma 2 proveniente de Fanny y otra en el cromosoma 6 proveniente de Oryzica Llanos 5, asociadas a resistencia en la progenie. Se estableció, entonces, que los genes de resistencia de los parentales son distintos, lo que significa que Fanny es una nueva fuente de resistencia. La asociación entre estas regiones cromosómicas y la resistencia fue, sin embargo, no significativa. El marcador tentativo para resistencia, RG190, fue descartado al no encontrarse correlación entre el alelo heredado de Fanny y la resistencia en la progenie. Este marcador no se pudo mapear en el cromosoma reportado en la literatura (cr. 12) y se esperan los resultados de la segregación de RG396 para identificar con precisión su localización en el mapa. En el mapa molecular construido se identificó, además, un nuevo locus para el marcador CDO38 y regiones de segregación sesgada en los cromosomas 1, 8 y 11.","tags":["RFLP","rice","hoja blanca","virus resistance"],"title":"Marcadores moleculares asociados a resistencia al virus de la hoja blanca de arroz (Oryza sativa L.)","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"6d99026b9e19e4fa43d5aadf147c7176","permalink":"https://lmdavalos.github.io/contact/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/contact/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"c1d17ff2b20dca0ad6653a3161942b64","permalink":"https://lmdavalos.github.io/people/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/people/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"}]
