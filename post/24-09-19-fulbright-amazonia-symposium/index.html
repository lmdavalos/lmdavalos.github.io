For the past three decades, she has been working at IPAM with the dynamics of deforestation, fire and forest degradation in relation to land use and climate change in the Amazon. She coordinates MapBiomas Fire, a comprehensive Brazil burned area monitoring initiative, as well as the Brazil Land Use Change Sector GHG estimate team of the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Estimation System (SEEG) initiative. She is one of the lead authors for the Scientific Panel for the Amazon and was recently listed as one of 14 female world leaders in the field of Machine Learning and Earth Observation by the Radiant Earth Foundation. As a Fulbright Amazonia Scholar, she will have the opportunity to integrate the knowledge of forest degradation by fire with other Pan Amazon countries in order to identify policy opportunities to reduce the impacts on Amazonian forest ecosystems.">

Her research explores how biodiversity changes in time and space, what biological processes fuel biodiversity, and what are the social factors of environmental degradation. Dávalos is a 2012 National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine Education Fellow in the Life Sciences and a 2013 Kavli Frontiers of Science Fellow for outstanding early career. She has advised the United Nations Office of Drug and Crime (UNODC) on deforestation in the Amazon-Andes since 2007, and is the author or coauthor of over 100 peer-reviewed journal articles, a coauthor of the 2016 and 2022 UNODC World Drug Reports and a co-editor of two volumes on zoology and environmental science, most recently, Phyllostomid Bats: A Unique Mammalian Radiation (University of Chicago Press, 2020). She serves as director of awards for the Society for Systematic Biologists, Associate Editor for the Society’s flagship journal, Systematic Biology, and Editor in Chief for the Quarterly Review of Biology. For her Fulbright Amazonia research, Dávalos aims to discover how coca production and, especially, drug trafficking contribute to deforestation and land-grabbing dynamics across the western Amazon. Through this work, she hopes to illuminate and help anticipate narco-trafficking as a cross-border, multi-scale market that contributes to environmental degradation and undermines human communities across the region.">

His research focus is on understanding how agricultural landscapes contribute to ecosystem services provision, mainly to biodiversity and carbon sequestration. For this, he uses a participatory approach to identify native tree species of interest and later studies its ecology with the aim of including them in silvopastoral arrangements. He also studies the role of agricultural landscapes on wildlife presence. In his master and doctoral studies, he assessed direct greenhouse gas emissions on dairy farms in Costa Rica and the role of trees in livestock landscapes in the Coastal and Amazon region in Ecuador to account for farm negative emissions. His Fulbright Amazonia research will focus on silvopastoral options for climate change mitigation and how to improve the connectivity between livestock landscapes in the South of Ecuador’s Amazon region. The project aims to map and identify existing silvopastoral practices in the region, and to understand how local governments could support the adoption of these practices through local policies. The project will include different stakeholders and will explore their willingness to adopt silvopastoral practices, by communicating the possible impacts on climate change mitigation and connectivity.">
